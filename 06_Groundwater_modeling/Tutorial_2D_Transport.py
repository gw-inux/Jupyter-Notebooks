    #### Question/Purpose of the model
    
    **🟥 Scenario A:** The general aim is the prediction and management of a contamination plume with constant release of solutes. To simulate the spreading of a solute from a point source in a confined, homogeneous and isotropic aquifer. The solute is introduced with a constant concentration. Observations exist at 100, 300, 500, and 1000 m distances.
    
    The situation is idealized and can be compared with the results of an analytical solution (2D solute transport from a continuous source with advection and dispersion). The analytical solution allows users to investigate the effects of different settings of the numerical model, like solution scheme and discretization.
    
    **🟩 Scenario B:** The general aim of this version is to use the numerical model to simulate a tracer test to characterize the aquifer. The solute is injected with a given mass over a very short term. The injection is a point source, i.e., the tracer is inserted through a point source as a Dirac impulse (10 liters in 10 seconds, containing 1,000 g NaCl). The observation is at a distance of 30 m.
    
    ---
    
    #### Conceptual model
    
    The confined aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic and sufficiently extends in the horizontal direction. The thickness of the confined aquifer is constant. Groundwater flows in a steady and uniform flow field with a defined specific velocity *q*, based on:
    
    Hydraulic gradient: *i* = 0.005  
    Hydraulic conductivity: *K* = 0.001 m/s
    
    Equation:
    
    $$
    q = -Ki = -0.001 \\times 0.005 = 5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s} \\; (0.432 \\text{ m/d})
    $$
    
    Solute input configurations:
    - **🟥 Scenario A:** Areal source with constant concentration; width of source is 100 m.
    - **🟩 Scenario B:** Point source with slug input. Total mass input is 1,000 g in 10 liters.
    
    ---
    
    #### Mathematical model and analytical solution
    
    The analytical solutions for both scenarios are provided in two dedicated Streamlit apps:
    
    - **🟥 Scenario A:** [transport-2d-continuous.streamlit.app](https://transport-2d-continuous.streamlit.app/)
    - **🟩 Scenario B:** [transport-2d-dirac.streamlit.app](https://transport-2d-dirac.streamlit.app/)
    
    ---
    
    #### Numerical model – flow and transport
    
    **Model characteristics:**
    - One-layer 2D domain
    - Model top at 0 m, aquifer thickness: 10 m
    - Horizontal extent: 2500 m × 1100 m
    - Initial cell size: 100 m × 100 m
    - Hydraulic conductivity *K* = 1×10⁻³ m/s
    - Specified-head boundaries on west and east edges
    
    ---
    
    **🟥 Scenario A:**
    - Temporal discretization: 1 period (steady state), duration 86,400,000 s (1,000 days)
    - Contamination source from *x* = 300 to 400 m (central row)
    - Defined concentration boundary: *c* = 1 g/m³
    - Observations at 100, 300, 500, and 1,000 m downstream
    - Purpose: Predict solute transport over 1,000 days
    
    **🟩 Scenario B:**
    - Temporal discretization: 3 periods  
      - Period 1: 1 s (steady-state)  
      - Period 2: 10 s (injection, transient)  
      - Period 3: 4,319,990 s (transport, transient)
    - Injection via WEL boundary (point source at *x* = 400 m, central row)
      - Infiltration rate: 0.001 m³/s for 10 s
      - Injection concentration: 100,000 g/m³ (i.e., 1,000 g in 10 L)

            #### Optionally STEPs: Further Investigations
            
            These steps are designed to expand your modeling skills and deepen your understanding of solute transport processes, numerical methods, and model performance. They complement the main tutorial and offer opportunities for independent exploration.
            
            **1. Compare alternative numerical solution methods**
            **Aim:** Explore the differences between available advection schemes in MT3D and understand their effects on model behavior.
            - Switch between FD, MOC, TVD, MMOC, and HMOC schemes in the ADV package.
            - Compare plume shapes, breakthrough curves (with the spreadsheet and the analytical solution), and mass balance errors.
            - Evaluate numerical dispersion and runtime across methods.
            
            **2. Introduce heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity**
            **Aim:** Investigate how spatial heterogeneity influences flow paths and solute transport.
            - Create zones or layers with varying hydraulic conductivity.
            - Implement block-wise structures or similar.
            - Visualize plume deformation and preferential pathways; also by using MODPATH.
            - Compare with results from a homogeneous setup.
            
            **3. Evaluate model performance under varying grid resolutions**
            **Aim:** Quantify the effect of discretization on numerical dispersion and computational cost.
            - Test multiple cell sizes (e.g., 100 m → 10 m → 2 m).
            - Monitor Peclet number and mass balance errors.
            - Use the analytical solution to quantify numerical error.
            - Plot error vs. cell size for FD and MOC.
            
            **4. Implement vertical layering (pseudo-3D)**
            **Aim:** Simulate simplified vertical transport and understand layer interactions.
            - Add a second or third model layer.
            - Vary vertical conductivity and dispersion.
            - Simulate upward or downward leakage.
            - Assess if the added complexity improves realism.
            
            **5. Design and interpret synthetic monitoring networks**
            **Aim:** Improve skills in selecting and interpreting monitoring locations.
            - Place observation wells at strategic distances and angles.
            - Analyze breakthrough curves and concentration time series.
            - Evaluate the representativeness of monitoring data relative to the full plume.
