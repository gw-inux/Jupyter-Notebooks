#### üí° Motivation - Exercise to understand options to account for streams in MODFLOW

Streams are common :blue[**physical boundaries**] in groundwater systems. Their diverse interactions with the groundwater make them ideal for demonstrating the full range of **MODFLOW boundary condition packages**.

This exercise helps to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach in relation to specific conceptual characteristics of the stream. It complements the boundary conditions introduced in this module and uses a simple, diagnostic scenario to highlight the implications of different implementation choices. Detailed :green[**tutorials and screencast videos**] help to follow the exercise with your own device

The exercise is inspired by *Reilly (2001) ‚Äì System and Boundary Conceptualization in Groundwater Flow Simulations (USGS TWRI 3‚ÄìB8)*.

#### üéØ Learning Objectives
By engaging with this exercise of the interactive module, you will be able to:

1. Explain how the different boundary conditions types can represent different conceptualizations of the stream-aquifer.

2. Identify which MODFLOW boundary packages can represent a stream under different conceputal assumptions.

3. Implement and compare alternative stream representations in a simple, steady-state model.

4. Evaluate implications for simulated heads, fluxes, and the water balance.

#### üß™ Some background information about conceptual ways of implementing streams in MODFLOW

Stream can appear in various ways in groundwater systems, for example as gaining streams, loosing streams, or even loosing streams that are disconnected from the groundwater.

     :rainbow[***Brief description of the conceptual model***]
        
    The conceptual model represents a highly idealized groundwater catchment and can be briefly described with the following key points:
    
    **Space and Time**
    - The idealized catchments has a rectangular area with the dimension 3100 m x 5100 m.
    - The earth surface is (in average) at 10 m. The aquifer bottom is at -50 m.
    - The time is considered as steady-state.
    
    **Structure and Parameters**
    - One homogeneous and isotropic aquifer composed of sand with *K* = 1E-4 m/s.
    
    **Boundary Conditions**
    - The catchment is bounded on the east by the :blue[**sea**], represented by a first type boundary condition (assuming that the sea is in direct hydraulical contact with the groundwater). The seawater level is at 0 m.
    - All other outer boundaries are :red[**no-flow**].
    - From the top, the model receives uniform areal (diffuse) :green[**groundwater recharge**].
    - The :blue[**stream**] is centrally placed and flows straight through the catchment. The head in the stream at the origin is 1m. The stream reaches the sea with a head of 0.
    - A water abstraction well is placed beside the stream with a distance of about 200 m.
    - For :red[**simplicity**], the conceptual model does :red[**NOT account for evapotranspiration FROM groundwater**].
    
    **Further Characteristics**
    - The catchment is flat and surface runoff can be neglected. The stream is solely fed by groundwater (gaining stream).
    
    :rainbow[***Brief description of the initial numerical model***]
    
    **Space and Time**
    - The model is rectangular and composed of 51 columns and 31 rows with a cell width of 100 m x 100 m.
    - The aquifer is represented by one layer with the top at 10 m and the bottom at -50 m.
    - The model time is set to steady-state.
    
    **Structure and Parameters**
    - The hydraulic conductivity *K* of homogeneous and isotropic aquifer is set to 1E-4 m/s.
    - The aquifer is considered as unconfined
    
    **Boundary Conditions**
    - The :blue[**sea**] is represented by the **CHD package** with a specified head of 0 m. The **CHD** boundary is set in the last column of the model grid at the east.
    - All other outer boundary conditions are No-Flow.
    - The :green[**groundwater recharge**] is 
      - defined over an area of 5000 m x 3100 m (the model area except the CHD cells at the eastern boundary)
      - with an areal rate of 6.45E-9 m/s (around 200 mm/a),
      - resulting in a total inflow of 0.1 m3/s.
    - The :blue[**stream**] 
      - is initially implemented with the RIV package.
      - The head of the stream is linearly interpolated from 1.0 m to 0.0 m (from the origin to the sea).
      - The conductance of the stream is set to 1E-5 m/s.
    - The :black[**abstraction well**]
      - is implemented by the WEL package.
      - The abstraction rate varies through the different scenarios from 0.01 m3/s (10% of RCH x Area) to 0.05 m3/s to 0.11 m3/s (110% of RCH x Area)
      
    **Software and solution**
    - Various versions of MODFLOW can be used for the exercise. The subsequent tutorial and screencasts were done with MODFLOW-2005 (Harbaugh 2005).

#### üßä How to Implement a Stream in MODFLOW with ModelMuse

In the following, we provide instructions and explanations on how to design a numerical model that represents a stream. The tutorial is based on MODFLOW-2005 using the graphical user interface ModelMuse, but the same model design principles can be applied with any other interface for the MODFLOW family of codes.

In the screencast, we demonstrate a variant where the stream is represented using the RIV package. Alternative formulations include the GHB and DRN packages.
