# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This Jupyter Notebook serves as an example of how to retrieve hydrogeological data in real-time using REST requests. It is a useful tool for accessing open data from the aquifer of interest, such as piezometric levels, temperature, and electrical conductivity.
  
  For this purpose, we illustrate how to retrieve hydrogeological data for the aquifers of Catalonia, sourced from the data generated by the Catalan Water Agency and stored in the open sensor platform Sentilo.
