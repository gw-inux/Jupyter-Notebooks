description_short: |
  This notebook presents the analytical 1-D solution for continuous solute transport in porous media without decay, following the classical formulation of Ogata & Banks (1961).

  Using the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and the dimensionless Péclet number, it evaluates solute concentrations as a function of space and time under purely advective–dispersive transport.
  The core equation includes two terms, one representing forward transport and the other accounting for upstream dispersion.
  
  The notebook explores when the second term becomes negligible depending on dispersivity, providing insight into advection-dominated versus dispersion-dominated regimes.
  
  Interactive widgets allow users to dynamically adjust parameters such as dispersivity, initial concentration, time, and the groundwater velocity to visualize their impact on concentration profiles. The notebook generates breakthrough curves and spatial concentration distributions, compares full and simplified analytical solutions, and examines contaminant arrival at an observation point. It serves as an intuitive tool for understanding fundamental 1-D transport processes in groundwater systems while reinforcing key concepts from classic hydrogeology literature.
