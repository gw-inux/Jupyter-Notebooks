# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive app illustrates one-dimensional solute transport under steady groundwater flow, focusing on the combined effects of advection and longitudinal dispersion. A finite-duration pulse input is applied at the source, and the app computes and plots the resulting breakthrough curve (concentration versus time) at a user-defined observation distance.
  
  Users can vary key transport parameters such as porosity and longitudinal dispersivity, and compare alternative representations by toggling between advection-only transport and the advection–dispersion solution. An optional set of example measurements can be displayed for visual comparison with the simulated breakthrough curve. The app supports conceptual understanding of plume spreading, travel times, and parameter sensitivity in 1D transport problems and is suited for teaching and self-study in hydrogeology and contaminant transport.
