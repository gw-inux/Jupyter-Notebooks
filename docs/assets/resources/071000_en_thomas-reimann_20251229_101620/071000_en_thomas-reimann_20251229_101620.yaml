# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive application illustrates three-dimensional heat transport in a saturated porous medium under steady groundwater flow, combining convection (advection), conduction, and hydrodynamic dispersion. A continuous heat input is applied at a finite source, and the resulting temperature distribution is evaluated from an analytical solution.
  
  Users can explore how specific discharge and effective porosity control the average groundwater velocity, how longitudinal and transverse dispersivities shape heat transport, and how source geometry (width and thickness) influences the extent of warming.
  
  Results are visualized as plan-view (x–y) temperature fields for a selectable depth slice and as cross-sections (x–z) for a selectable lateral position, shown either as filled contours or isolines. Optional settings allow restricting spreading to downward directions to mimic density-driven tendencies or simplified conceptual assumptions.
