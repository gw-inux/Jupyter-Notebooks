description_short: |
  Groundwater models are only as good as the accuracy of both the system representation (including boundary conditions) and the values of observations used to calibrate the model. This interactive module is designed to deepen the understanding of the basic ways in which different types of boundary conditions - specified head, specified flow, and head-dependent flow - influence the magnitude and direction of groundwater flow when used in solving the partial differential equation for groundwater flow.
  
  This module offers intuitive visualizations, conceptual explanations, and interactive tools to help bridge theory and application for beginning modelers, advanced students, and practicing hydrogeologists.
  
  This module is intended for beginners who know a little about groundwater models and are ready to learn about boundary conditions, as well as advanced and experienced users who wish to refresh their understanding of specific boundary types. A basic familiarity with hydrogeology and groundwater flow is recommended, but no prior experience with MODFLOW is required.
  
  Structure of the module: The Introduction Section provides an overview of groundwater models and introduces the role of boundary conditions in MODFLOW. Following this, each MODFLOW basic boundary condition (GHB, RIV, DRN, MNW2, ET) is presented in its own dedicated section, where the concepts, applications, and implications are explained in detail.
  
  The Module is published in ZENODO as: Reimann, T., Poeter, E., & Kuniansky, E.L. (2025a). Boundary Condition Module. An interactive educational resource for The Groundwater Project. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17624993
