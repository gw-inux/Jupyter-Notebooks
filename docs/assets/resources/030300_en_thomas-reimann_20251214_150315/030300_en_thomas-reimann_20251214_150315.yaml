# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: >
  This app compares analytical solutions for one-dimensional groundwater flow in confined and unconfined aquifers bounded by two specified head boundaries. Both systems are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic with a horizontal base and no groundwater recharge, allowing a direct comparison of the resulting head distributions.
  
  
  Users can interactively adjust hydraulic conductivity, aquifer length, and boundary heads to explore how flow behavior differs between confined (linear head distribution) and unconfined (nonlinear head distribution) conditions. The side-by-side visualization supports conceptual understanding of aquifer type, boundary control, and the fundamental differences between confined and unconfined flow regimes.
