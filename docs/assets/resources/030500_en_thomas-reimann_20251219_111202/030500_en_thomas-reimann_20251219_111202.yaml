# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: >
  This interactive app demonstrates steady-state radial flow to a pumping well in an unconfined aquifer using the Thiem (Dupuit–Thiem) equation. Users explore how hydraulic conductivity (log-scaled), initial water-table elevation, and well radius control the drawdown cone and the abstraction rate.
  
  
  Two usage modes are provided:
  
  * Specify drawdown (s): the app computes the corresponding pumping rate (Q) and an influence radius (R) (Sichardt-type estimate).
  
  * Specify pumping rate (Q): the app iteratively determines well water level (h_w) and radius of influence (R), and flags conditions where the well may run dry (no feasible steady-state solution).
  
  The resulting water-table profile h(r) is plotted symmetrically around the well, including the unaffected head outside the influence radius. Key outputs (drawdown at the well and pumping rate) are reported to support conceptual understanding and sensitivity exploration.
