# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive app supports pumping-test evaluation in confined aquifers using the classical Theis solution. Measured drawdown data are compared to the analytical well function, allowing users to interactively fit transmissivity (T) and storativity (S) through type-curve matching and direct numerical evaluation of the Theis equation.
  
  The app combines two complementary views:
  
  * (1) a logarithmic Theis type-curve plot with measured data points, and
  * (2) a time–drawdown plot showing both fitted results and forward predictions at user-defined distances, pumping rates, and time horizons.
  
  By adjusting aquifer parameters in real time, users can explore parameter sensitivity, understand the inverse problem of pumping-test interpretation, and immediately assess how estimated parameters influence drawdown predictions. The tool is intended for teaching and self-learning in hydrogeology and complements theoretical material on transient radial flow to wells.
