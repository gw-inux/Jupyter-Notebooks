description_short: >
  This app extends the 1D unconfined flow calibration exercise by introducing a no-flow boundary on one side and, on the other side, either a specified-head boundary or a head-dependent (river-type) boundary. The conceptual model assumes a homogeneous, isotropic aquifer with a horizontal impermeable base and uniform recharge over the entire model length.
  
  
  Users can generate synthetic calibration datasets (regular or irregular sampling, optionally with noise) and then estimate model parameters by adjusting recharge and hydraulic conductivity. In the head-dependent scenario, an additional boundary parameter (river conductance) is included, allowing learners to experience how boundary formulation increases calibration complexity and parameter non-uniqueness. Model performance can be evaluated using an optional scatter plot and basic error metrics (ME, MAE, RMSE), and the app can reveal the “true” parameter values for self-assessment.
