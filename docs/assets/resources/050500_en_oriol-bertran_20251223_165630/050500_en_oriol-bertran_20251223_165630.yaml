description_short: |
  This notebook demonstrates the principle of superposition applied to one-dimensional solute transport in porous media. Since the advection–dispersion equation is linear in concentration, individual concentration contributions from different sources or release events can be added to obtain the total solution.
  
  The notebook first defines the governing transport equation for continuous injection without decay, using the classical Ogata–Banks analytical solution.
  It then sets up helper functions for dispersion, the Péclet number, and concentration calculations, along with interactive widgets that allow the user to modify input parameters and visually explore how multiple releases combine.
  
  Two practical examples illustrate how superposition works in groundwater contamination scenarios. In the first example, two overlapping continuous releases—one starting at time zero and another beginning later—are simulated independently and then added to obtain the combined breakthrough curve at an observation point.
  
  In the second example, a pulse injection is represented by subtracting two continuous injections, showing how a short-duration spill can be reconstructed using linearity. Interactive plots reveal the timing, peak concentration, and dissipation behavior of each scenario, giving users an intuitive understanding of how linear transport processes respond to multiple or time-varying sources.
