# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: >
  This interactive app illustrates transient groundwater drawdown induced by pumping from a fully penetrating well. It is based on the classical Theis solution for confined aquifers and an adapted formulation for unconfined aquifers, allowing a direct comparison between both hydrogeological conditions.
  
  Users can explore how pumping rate, transmissivity, storativity (or specific yield), aquifer thickness, distance from the well, and time influence drawdown patterns. The app visualizes drawdown profiles symmetrically around the pumping well and highlights differences between confined and unconfined responses under otherwise identical conditions.
  
  The tool is designed for teaching and self-learning in hydrogeology, supporting conceptual understanding of radial flow to wells, parameter sensitivity, and the limitations of analytical solutions. It is particularly suited for undergraduate and graduate courses covering groundwater hydraulics, pumping tests, and aquifer characterization.
