# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive module introduces the fundamental concepts of soil water retention in unsaturated soils and provides a structured, hands-on exploration of the van Genuchten–Mualem formulation, one of the most widely applied models in vadose zone hydrology.
  
  The module explains how water is retained in soils under unsaturated conditions, emphasizing the physical meaning of capillary pressure, pore-size distribution, and effective saturation. Users interactively explore how key model parameters (θᵣ, θₛ, α, n) control the shape of soil water retention curves and influence hydraulic behavior.
  
  Designed as a step-by-step learning resource, the module supports both first-time learners and users seeking to refresh or deepen their understanding. Interactive visualizations are combined with guided exercises that promote conceptual understanding, parameter interpretation, and practical model calibration.
  
  Module Structure
  
  📚 Theory
  Introduces the physical basis of soil water retention, including capillarity, surface tension, and the conceptual background of the van Genuchten–Mualem model.
  
  📈 SWRC Interactive
  Enables real-time exploration of how individual model parameters affect soil water retention curves.
  
  📊 SWRC in Comparison
  Facilitates comparison of retention behavior across different soil textures (e.g., sand, loam, silt).
  
  🧪 Exercise 1
  Focuses on fitting the van Genuchten model to measured retention data and interpreting parameter sensitivity.
  
  🧪 Exercise 2
  Uses synthetic datasets to identify soil types and assess implications for agricultural use and flow processes.
