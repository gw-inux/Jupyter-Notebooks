# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive tutorial guides users step by step through the design, implementation, and analysis of a 2D steady-state groundwater flow model for a synthetic catchment using MODFLOW-2005 in combination with MODELMUSE. The application is structured as an expandable to-do–based workflow, supported by explanatory text, figures, downloadable resources, and short instructional videos that mirror a typical professional modeling process.
  
  Starting from grid discretization and parameter definition, the tutorial covers the setup of boundary conditions (constant head, recharge, river, and wells), execution of the numerical simulation, and systematic postprocessing, including hydraulic head visualization and particle tracking with MODPATH. Optional refinement steps allow users to further explore grid design and numerical sensitivity. The app is intended for academic teaching and guided self-study, providing a practical introduction to conceptualization, numerical setup, and interpretation of groundwater flow models in a controlled and transparent learning environment.
