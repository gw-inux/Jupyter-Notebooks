# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive app illustrates groundwater particle tracking by following a conceptual tracer particle as it is transported through an aquifer by advective groundwater flow.
  
  Users can adjust the entry position of the particle, the time since recharge, and key hydrogeological parameters such as recharge rate, aquifer thickness, and effective porosity. Based on these inputs, the app computes and visualizes the particle’s flow path and its evolving horizontal position and depth over time. A highlighted marker and guide lines show the particle location at a user-selected time step, helping to connect parameter changes directly to travel distance and travel time.
  
  The module provides an intuitive introduction to a Lagrangian perspective on groundwater transport and supports discussion of travel times, flow paths, and the sensitivity of advective movement to recharge and aquifer properties under steady-state conditions.
