# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: >
  This app illustrates the Ghyben–Herzberg relation for the equilibrium between freshwater and seawater in a coastal aquifer under static (no-flow) conditions. Starting from the classical sharp-interface concept, it visualizes how a relatively small freshwater head above sea level supports a much thicker freshwater body below sea level due to the density contrast between fresh and salt water. Users can interactively adjust the freshwater and saltwater densities as well as the freshwater head at the inland boundary, and immediately see how the position of the freshwater–saltwater interface responds. The cross-section plot distinguishes unsaturated zone, freshwater zone, and underlying saltwater, making the app well suited for teaching the basic physics, assumptions, and limitations of the Ghyben–Herzberg theorem in an intuitive, graphical way.
