# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive app demonstrates pumping-test evaluation and drawdown prediction with the Theis solution for a confined aquifer, using real field datasets in addition to a synthetic textbook example.
  
  Users can select an observation-well dataset (e.g., Varnum/Sweden test series, Viterbo/Italy 2023) or upload their own CSV file, and then visually match measured drawdown data to the Theis well function by adjusting transmissivity (T) and storativity (S) on logarithmic sliders.
  
  The app combines two linked views:
  * (1) a type-curve matching plot (well function vs. measured points) to support inverse parameter fitting, and
  * (2) a prediction plot that uses the fitted parameters to compute drawdown over time for user-defined pumping rate, distance, and prediction period.
  
  Parameter summaries are reported for both the fitted interpretation (including hydraulic conductivity derived from aquifer thickness) and the forward prediction.
