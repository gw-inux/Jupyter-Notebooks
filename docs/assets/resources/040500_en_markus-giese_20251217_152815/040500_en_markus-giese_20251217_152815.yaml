description_short: >
  This app introduces the Horton model and shows how it controls infiltration-excess (Hortonian) overland flow during intense rainfall. Users can interactively adjust the initial infiltration capacity, the equilibrium capacity, the decay rate, and the rainfall intensity.  This helps to understand how the infiltration capacity curve evolves over a rain event and when rainfall begins to exceed it. The plot highlights periods when all rainfall infiltrates versus when surface runoff is generated, while integrated initial and final assessments help students check their understanding of the key concepts behind Horton’s formulation and its role in partitioning rainfall into infiltration and runoff.
