# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a simple MODFLOW-CFP (CFPy) model setup (after Birk, 2002) to analyze a karst conduit system’s transient response to a short discharge/recharge event. Using FloPy and CFPy, the notebook builds a 2D continuum grid with a 1D conduit network, applies steady-state initialization followed by a transient injection period and recovery phase, and runs the coupled flow simulation with the MODFLOW-CFP executable.
  
  Three (or more) scenarios are computed by varying different model parameters. Results are postprocessed to extract conduit flow rates through time and compare how parameter changes affect the spring discharge response.
