# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This app is designed to guide non-experts through the use of groundwater models to answer a water resources question. It is presented in eight steps, with an assignment given after every second step.
  
  * Step 1 General discussion of how surrounding stakeholders might be affected by mine dewatering - qualitative discussion of the response of an aquifer to pumping.
  
  * Step 2 Quantitative predictions of drawdown versus distance and time for different Q, T, and S.
  
  * Step 3 Convert drawdown to utility for three stakeholders.
  
  * Step 4 Introducing Pareto optimization of pumping among stakeholders.
  
  * Step 5 Putting Pareto optimization in practice.
  
  * Step 6 Perform a pumping test on data with error to infer T and S with uncertainty.
  
  * Step 7 Bayesian multimodel analysis.
  
  * Step 8 Reality: why these methods are almost never used!
  
  The app comes with several interactive plots, assignments, electronic questions for assessing knowledge, and educator notes.
