# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive app demonstrates baseflow recession in a catchment after the end of recharge. It computes and visualizes the decline of discharge over time based on a simple recession model.
  
  Users can vary the initial discharge and the recession constant to explore their influence on recession behavior and extract discharge values at selected times. The app supports conceptual understanding of catchment storage and baseflow dynamics in hydrology and groundwater studies.
