# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This application reproduces and extends the classical Example 1 from the MT3DMS documentation, illustrating one-dimensional solute transport in a uniform groundwater flow field. A coupled MODFLOW–MT3DMS model is used to simulate conservative and reactive transport processes under controlled conditions.
  
  The app allows users to explore the influence of advection, dispersion, sorption, and decay on solute migration by systematically activating or deactivating individual processes. Different numerical advection schemes (finite difference, MOC, TVD) can be compared to assess numerical behavior, stability, and solution accuracy.
  
  The model is implemented using FloPy for transparent pre- and post-processing, enabling users to focus on conceptual understanding rather than model setup. Concentration profiles, mass balance information, and method-dependent differences can be directly visualized and discussed. It is recommended to run the Jupyter Notebook on a local computer.
  
  Intended use:
  Conceptual learning, numerical-method comparison, and advanced coursework in groundwater solute transport and numerical modeling.
