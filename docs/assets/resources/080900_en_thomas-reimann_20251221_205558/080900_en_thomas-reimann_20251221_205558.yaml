# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This tutorial demonstrates how to set up and run a numerical pumping test in a confined aquifer using MODFLOW-2005. It guides users through model discretization, parameter definition, boundary conditions, simulation, and postprocessing, and shows how the generated results can be exported and analyzed in the Pumping Test Module to compare numerical drawdown with the Theis solution.
