# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive app extends the particle-tracking concept to a bundle of multiple groundwater particles, allowing users to explore how neighboring recharge points evolve into distinct yet related flow paths and travel times within an aquifer.
  
  Starting from a central entry position, a user-defined number of particles is released with a specified horizontal spacing. All particles are advected by the same steady-state flow field, and their trajectories are visualized simultaneously. The central particle is highlighted, while the surrounding particles provide context on the spreading of flow paths caused by differences in initial position under identical hydraulic conditions.
  
  By interactively adjusting recharge rate, aquifer thickness, effective porosity, entry location, and particle spacing, users can examine how small variations in starting position influence travel distance, depth evolution, and arrival times. The app supports discussion of advective transport, flow-path divergence, and travel-time distributions, and provides an intuitive introduction to multi-particle Lagrangian analysis commonly used in groundwater modeling and capture-zone assessments under steady-state conditions.
