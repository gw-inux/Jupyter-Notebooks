# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: >
  This interactive Streamlit app helps learners understand how the relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay define a soil texture class in a soil texture triangle (e.g., FAO, 2006). A randomly generated soil sample is displayed as a red point in a ternary diagram, and users estimate the corresponding percentages by entering values for clay, sand, and silt.
  
  
  After submitting their guess, the app provides instant feedback indicating which components are correct or incorrect. A restart button generates a new sample point so users can practice repeatedly and build intuition for reading and interpreting soil texture triangles.
