# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: >
  This Streamlit app is an interactive learning tool for steady-state radial flow to a pumping well in a confined aquifer using the Thiem equation. Users explore how aquifer properties and well characteristics control the drawdown curve and the pumping rate required to achieve a target drawdown.
  
  
  The interface provides sliders for key parameters: the unaffected hydraulic head (H), aquifer thickness (m), and hydraulic conductivity (K, adjusted on a log scale), as well as the well radius (rₙ). A toggle lets users choose between two modes: (i) prescribe a drawdown at the well and compute the corresponding abstraction rate Q, or (ii) prescribe Q and compute the resulting head distribution.
  
  
  Based on the selected parameters, the app iteratively determines an effective radius of influence (R) and then calculates the hydraulic head h(r) from the Thiem solution. The resulting drawdown profile is plotted symmetrically around the well to visualize the cone of depression and its spatial extent. If parameters imply that the computed head drops below the aquifer thickness (indicating a transition toward unconfined conditions), the app flags this with a clear warning in the plot.
  
  
  A compact output panel summarizes the drawdown at the well and the computed abstraction rate, supporting quick interpretation and “what-if” experimentation. Overall, the app helps students and practitioners build intuition for confined well hydraulics and parameter sensitivity in a transparent, hands-on way.
