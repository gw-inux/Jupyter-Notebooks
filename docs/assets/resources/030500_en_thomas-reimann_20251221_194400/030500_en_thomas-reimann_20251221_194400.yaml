# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive application illustrates transient radial flow toward a pumping well in a confined aquifer using the classical Theis solution. Users can explore how pumping rate, transmissivity, storativity, distance, and time control drawdown by adjusting parameters interactively. The app computes drawdown analytically and visualizes the resulting spatial drawdown distribution in real time, making it suitable for teaching and self-study of fundamental concepts in groundwater hydraulics and pumping-test interpretation.
