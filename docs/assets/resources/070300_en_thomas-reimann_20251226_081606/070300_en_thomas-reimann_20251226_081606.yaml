# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive app visualizes the well capture zone (capture width and dividing streamlines) for a single pumping well in a confined aquifer subject to regional uniform groundwater flow.
  
  Users adjust the pumping rate, hydraulic conductivity, aquifer thickness, and regional hydraulic gradient (with log-scaled sliders) and immediately see how these parameters control the shape and extent of the capture zone in plan view. 
  
  In addition to plotting the separating streamlines, the app reports two key diagnostic quantities: the total capture-zone width 2y_max and the culmination point x_0, which together provide a compact characterization of the contributing area feeding the well under steady-state conditions.
  
  This tool supports conceptual understanding of wellhead protection and capture-zone sensitivity in confined aquifers and complements the theory section of the multipage well-capture module.
