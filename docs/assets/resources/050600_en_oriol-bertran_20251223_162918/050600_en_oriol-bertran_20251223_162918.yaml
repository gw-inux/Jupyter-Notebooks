# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: |
  This interactive Jupyter tool computes and visualizes the analytical 2-D instantaneous solute injection solution with first-order decay in porous media.
  It simulates how concentration evolves over time at a given observation point for five contaminants, each defined by a different decay rate.
  The model incorporates:
  * 1) Retardation
  * 2) Longitudinal and transversal dispersion
  * 3) Decay
  * 4) 2-D spreading of an instantaneous point source
  
  The user can interactively modify: 
  * 1) Distance to the observation point (x, y)
  * 2) Longitudinal and transversal dispersivities
  * 3) Retardation factor
  
  The tool then automatically recalculates:
  * 1) Effective velocity
  * 2) Effective longitudinal and transverse dispersion
  * 3) Time-dependent concentration curves
  
  and plots the concentration–time profiles for all decay rates, allowing easy comparison of attenuation behavior in 2-D groundwater flow.
