# --- CONTENT AND METADATA ---
description_short: >
  This app explores upconing of the freshwater–saltwater interface beneath a pumping well in a coastal aquifer. Using a sharp-interface analytical solution, it shows how the interface rises toward the well as you adjust key parameters such as pumping rate, hydraulic conductivity, porosity, density contrast, and pre-pumping distance to the interface. The interactive plot highlights the upconed interface, the maximum upconing at the well, and a critical pumping rate/elevation, helping users understand when pumping remains safe and when the risk of salinisation becomes significant.
