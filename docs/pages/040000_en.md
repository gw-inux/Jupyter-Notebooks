# 04 Vadose Zone Physics

Covers the physical processes related to water and air in the unsaturated zone. Includes soil hydraulic properties, relationships of water saturation to hydraulic potential and permeability, and flow mechanisms above the water table. Emphasizes process-based understanding of water retention, unsaturated flow, and infiltration dynamics.
