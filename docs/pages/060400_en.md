### 1. Slugtest Evaluation

**Type:** Streamlit app | **Time:** 15–30 minutes

> ![Slugtest Evaluation]({{ "/assets/resources/060400_en_thomas-reimann_20251209_102205/060400_en_thomas-reimann_20251209_102205_fig1.jpg" | relative_url }})

This application introduces slug tests in unconfined aquifers and provides an interactive environment for evaluating slug test data using the Bouwer & Rice (1976) method. Core explanatory content (text, figure captions, buttons, etc.) can be translated on the fly into multiple languages using an integrated translation routine that preserves Markdown/HTML structure and protects key hydrogeological terminology through a custom dictionary.
Users can work with predefined field datasets (Varnum, Sweden; Viterbo, Italy), upload their own CSV data, or generate synthetic noisy data for practice. The app allows adjusting well and screen parameters, slug size, time offset and hydraulic conductivity, and visualizes the resulting response curve together with measured heads. Optional scatter plots with ME, MAE and RMSE, as well as download functions for figures and data, support quantitative evaluation and self-guided learning about parameter fitting and uncertainty in slug test analysis.

Pumping tests are one of the most important methods for acquiring information about groundwater systems. A pumping test provides values of aquifer transmissivity T and storativity S and in some settings, other hydraulic parameter values. This module is designed to introduce the evaluation of pumping tests for confined, unconfined, and leaky aquifers. The Pumping Test Analysis Module is provided by The Groundwater Project and developed in  cooperation with the iNUX project. The module forms part of a broader initiative to create interactive, open-access educational resources for groundwater science and engineering.
Overview of the module: This module combines theoretical explanations with interactive applications and exercises. Quizzes inside the module allow you to assess your understanding. The underlying theory is provided as a concise overview at the beginning. First, the general response of aquifers to groundwater abstraction is explained as a cone of water-level drawdown expanding outward from a well over time. Then we explore how pumping test data can be evaluated to estimate hydraulic parameters such as transmissivity and storativity for: confined, leaky, and unconfined aquifers. Opportunities are offered to explore the evaluation methods with a few different synthetic and idealized data that originate from textbooks, as well as measured data from the Varnum test site in Sweden, the Viterbo test site in Italy, the Pirna test site in Germany, and you can also use your own data in the Pumping Test Analysis section.

### 3. The Theis solution for pumping test evaluation

**Type:** Streamlit app | **Time:** 30–45 minutes

> ![The Theis solution for pumping test evaluation]({{ "/assets/resources/060400_en_thomas-reimann_20251209_100736/060400_en_thomas-reimann_20251209_100736_fig1.jpg" | relative_url }})

*Figure 1: The Theis Type-Curve that is generated by the app.*

This application provides an interactive environment for understanding and applying the Theis solution for pumping-test evaluation in confined aquifers. It includes a dynamically generated Theis type curve, tools to explore dimensionless time and well-function behavior, and functionality for manual type-curve matching following standard hydrogeological practice. Users may load synthetic or own field data, visualize measured drawdown on log–log or semi-log axes, and export figures for offline matching.
Based on selected match-point values, the app computes transmissivity and storativity, illustrating how aquifer parameters are derived from transient drawdown observations. Additional guidance is provided through step-by-step instructions, an embedded video tutorial, and an example of a completed manual match.
