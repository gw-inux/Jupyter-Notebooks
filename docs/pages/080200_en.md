## Interactive Resources (02 Numerical Schemes)

### 1. Finite Difference Numerical Scheme

**Type:** Streamlit app | **Time:** 15–30 minutes

**Purpose and Functionality** The app implements the one-dimensional finite difference method for groundwater flow with two fixed head boundary conditions. Users can specify the spatial discretization by selecting the number of cells, upon which the numerical scheme is set up and solved.
**Learning Features** The app visualizes the iterative development of the numerical solution and illustrates how the approximation approaches a stable state. A built-in analytical reference solution enables direct comparison, supporting the exploration of error behaviour, convergence, and numerical representation of groundwater flow processes.
