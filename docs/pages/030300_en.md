This app illustrates the analytical solution for one-dimensional groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer subject to two specified head boundaries and uniform recharge. The conceptual model assumes a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer with a horizontal base, bounded by fixed hydraulic heads at the inflow and outflow boundaries.
Users can interactively explore the influence of recharge, hydraulic conductivity, aquifer length, and boundary heads on the resulting hydraulic head distribution. The visualization highlights characteristic features such as groundwater divides and recharge effects, making the app well suited for teaching fundamental concepts of steady unconfined groundwater flow and boundary-controlled systems.

This app compares analytical solutions for one-dimensional groundwater flow in confined and unconfined aquifers bounded by two specified head boundaries. Both systems are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic with a horizontal base and no groundwater recharge, allowing a direct comparison of the resulting head distributions.
Users can interactively adjust hydraulic conductivity, aquifer length, and boundary heads to explore how flow behavior differs between confined (linear head distribution) and unconfined (nonlinear head distribution) conditions. The side-by-side visualization supports conceptual understanding of aquifer type, boundary control, and the fundamental differences between confined and unconfined flow regimes.
