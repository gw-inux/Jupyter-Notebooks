# **The iNUX PROJECT**

## Project Overview

Welcome to the open-source catalog for **iNUX – interactive understanding of groundwater hydrogeology**.

Groundwater is a vital, yet unseen, resource, often inadequately covered in standard education. This Erasmus+ cooperation project addresses this gap by developing **interactive and digital teaching material** focused on fundamental and applied hydrogeology. We use practical experience from leading European universities to provide resources covering basic theory, field, and laboratory applications across diverse European environments.

All materials are freely available under an open-source license.

## 🚀 Quick Access to Resources

Our resources are designed to enhance self-controlled learning for students and professionals. Jump straight into the interactive content or explore the full repository.

| Resource Type | Description | Access Point |

## Featured Interactive Tool: Radioactive Decay App

Get started immediately with a powerful simulation tool.

**Purpose:** Investigate the mass balance for substances undergoing decay. Define initial mass and decay rates for three components to analyze their mass balance over time.
**Access:** [**Radioactive Decay App**](https://radioactive-decay.streamlit.app/)

## Deep Dive: How to Use Our Interactive Documents

### Streamlit Apps: Zero Setup

These apps are designed for simplicity. You need **no local installation** and can use them directly on any device with a web browser (desktop, tablet, or phone). Streamlit handles the computational backend, giving you immediate access to interactive models.

### Jupyter Notebooks: Combining Code and Theory

Jupyter Notebooks offer a higher degree of freedom, allowing for immediate modification and individual analysis using **Python** computations.

#### A. Online Access (Recommended Quick Start)

You can process notebooks directly in your browser using the MyBinder service.

* **Access Link:** [**Launch Binder Service**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gw-inux/Jupyter-Notebooks/HEAD?urlpath=tree)

> **Note on MyBinder:** The initial start can take a few minutes as MyBinder sets up a dedicated server for you. Subsequent starts should be faster.

#### B. Local Access (Offline Use)

For long-term or offline work, you can download the notebooks and run them locally. This requires installing **Python** and a platform like **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab** (often conveniently distributed via **Anaconda**). Refer to the iNUX Handbook for detailed setup instructions.
