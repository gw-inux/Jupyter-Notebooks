    ### Dewatering exercise 💦
    ---
    ## Step 4
    Discuss how stakeholders can use utility to find a compromise decision for the dewatering rate?
    
    Consider that the values of T, S, and the distances to the stakeholder interests are known and correct.
    
    Use any tools that have been shown to you previously to explore the utilities of different pumping rates for all stakeholders.    
    
    You should agree upon the utility curves for each stakeholder before you begin your analyses.    
    
    You should work as a class, with each person exploring two different Q values that you decide upon collectively.
    
    Produce a common table with Q and utility for each stakeholder.
    
    Once you have your table complete, discuss how you can use it to choose the best Q from those that you examined.
    
    Introduce Pareto optimization generally and discuss how it could be applied to this problem for the mine and the town.

    
    
    #### Assignment after step 4.
    - Plot the utility for the mine against the utility for the town using a point for each dewatering rate considered in class.
    - Explain the meaning of the Pareto Front.
    - Choose one pumping rate that is not on the front and explain in a clear paragraph why it is not among the optimal pumping rates.
