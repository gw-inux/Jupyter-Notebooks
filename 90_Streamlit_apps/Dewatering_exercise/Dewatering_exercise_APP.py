    # Ty's comment
    
    #### **Assignment after step 2.**
    Produce three curves of _s(t)_ out to two years, one at the distance relevant for each stakeholder, on the same axes.
    Explain in a clear paragraph why they all have the same general shape, but they are different in the details.
    Discuss your understanding at this time of the role of a hydrogeologist in negotiating water issues related to dewatering.
    
    #### **Assignment after step 4.**
    Plot the utility for the mine against the utility for the town using a point for each dewatering rate considered in class.
    Explain the meaning of the Pareto Front.
    Choose one pumping rate that is not on the front and explain in a clear paragraph why it is not among the optimal pumping rates.
    
    #### **Assignment after step 6.**
    How should each stakeholder decide which fit to trust?
    Can you think of an objective way to find the best model?  What are the limitations to this approach?
    Can you think of an objective way to use all three models?
    Comment on the value of improving data quality for hydrogeologic analyses.
    What are the risks or potential costs of poor data quality?
    
    #### **Assignment after step 8.**
    Self-reflection ‚Äì what did you learn in this part of the class?
    Do you expect that you might use what you learned in your career?  In your personal life?
    How could this section have been improved?
