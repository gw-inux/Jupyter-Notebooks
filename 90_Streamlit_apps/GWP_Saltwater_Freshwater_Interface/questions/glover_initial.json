    "question": "In the Glover framework, increasing the freshwater hydraulic gradient i toward the sea (all else equal) tends to:",
    "options": {
      "Move the saltwater toe further inland.": false,
      "Reduce freshwater discharge to the sea.": false,
      "Push the interface deeper near the coast and shift the saltwater toe seaward.": true,
      "Have no effect on the freshwater–saltwater interface.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — a higher freshwater gradient increases seaward flow, which tends to deepen the interface at the coast and push the saltwater toe seaward.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — in the Glover model, increasing the land-to-sea gradient strengthens freshwater discharge and pushes the interface seaward, not landward."
  },
  {
    "question": "For which setting is the Glover equation most appropriate as a first approximation?",
    "options": {
      "A homogeneous coastal aquifer with steady, primarily horizontal freshwater flow toward the sea and a relatively sharp interface.": true,
      "A karst system with conduit flow and complex vertical circulation.": false,
      "A strongly tidal estuary with rapidly varying heads at the coast.": false,
      "A heavily pumped multi-layer system with strong vertical leakage.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly — the Glover solution is intended for relatively simple, homogeneous coastal aquifers with steady, mainly horizontal flow and a sharp interface.",
    "error": "❌ Try again — Glover is not designed for highly complex, pumped, karst, or strongly tidal systems."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following are standard assumptions of the classical Glover model?",
    "options": {
      "Homogeneous, isotropic aquifer of constant thickness.": true,
      "Dupuit-type horizontal flow with a sharp freshwater–saltwater interface.": true,
      "Fully transient variable-density flow in a thick mixing zone.": false,
      "Constant seawater head at the coast and steady-state conditions.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — the classical Glover model assumes a homogeneous, isotropic aquifer of constant thickness, Dupuit-type horizontal flow with a sharp interface, and steady-state conditions with a constant head at the sea.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — remember that Glover is a steady, sharp-interface, horizontally averaged model and does not handle full transient variable-density flow in a thick mixing zone."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does freshwater overlie saltwater in a coastal aquifer under natural conditions? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "Freshwater has a lower density than saltwater.": true,
      "Hydraulic gradients always force freshwater upward.": false,
      "Buoyancy causes denser saltwater to occupy deeper parts of the aquifer.": true,
      "Saltwater cannot flow within porous media.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — the density difference between freshwater and saltwater leads to buoyancy effects, with lighter freshwater overlying denser saltwater.",
    "error": "❌ Recall that buoyancy due to density contrast controls vertical positioning of fresh and saline water, not hydraulic gradients or flow restrictions."
