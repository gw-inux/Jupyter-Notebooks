    "question": "Which statement best describes saltwater upconing near a pumping well in a coastal aquifer?",
    "options": {
      "Saltwater upconing is caused by dispersion alone and occurs even without pumping.": false,
      "Saltwater upconing occurs when pumping lowers freshwater heads and draws the freshwater–saltwater interface upward toward the well.": true,
      "Saltwater upconing is only possible in confined aquifers.": false,
      "Saltwater upconing always results in a stable interface position regardless of pumping rate.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — pumping reduces freshwater heads and can pull the interface upward toward the well, creating an upconing shape beneath/around the well.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — upconing is driven primarily by pumping-induced drawdown and the resulting upward movement of the interface, not by dispersion alone."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following changes will generally increase the risk of saltwater upconing at a pumping well? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "Increasing pumping rate.": true,
      "Placing the well screen closer to the freshwater–saltwater interface.": true,
      "Reducing the vertical hydraulic conductivity or anisotropy such that vertical flow is more restricted.": false,
      "Increasing the distance between the well and the coastline.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — higher pumping rates and screens closer to the interface both increase the likelihood that saltwater will be drawn upward toward the well.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — the strongest risk factors are higher pumping and a screen placed close to the interface; moving farther inland generally reduces coastal salinization risk."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a sharp-interface conceptual model of upconing, which indicator most directly signals that the well is about to start producing saline water?",
    "options": {
      "The freshwater head increases above its initial value.": false,
      "The interface rises and intersects (or approaches) the well screen.": true,
      "The aquifer porosity decreases.": false,
      "Recharge becomes zero everywhere.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — salinization risk becomes critical when the interface rises to the level of the well screen (or very close to it).",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — the key threshold is the interface elevation relative to the well screen, not changes in porosity or a global recharge shutdown."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which mitigation strategies are commonly recommended to reduce saltwater upconing risk? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "Lowering pumping rates or using intermittent pumping.": true,
      "Raising the well screen (or pumping from a shallower interval) to keep it farther above the interface.": true,
      "Increasing pumping rates to flush saltwater away from the well.": false,
      "Relocating pumping further inland or distributing pumping among multiple wells.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — reducing pumping stress and increasing separation between screen and interface (or moving/distributing pumping inland) are standard approaches to lower upconing risk.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — increasing pumping generally worsens upconing; mitigation focuses on reducing drawdown near the interface and/or increasing separation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does a strong vertical hydraulic conductivity (or weak anisotropy) generally increase the tendency for upconing beneath a pumping well?",
    "options": {
      "Because it makes vertical flow easier, allowing the interface to deform upward more readily under pumping.": true,
      "Because it prevents any vertical gradients from forming.": false,
      "Because it eliminates the density difference between freshwater and saltwater.": false,
      "Because it guarantees that the interface will remain perfectly flat.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — when vertical flow is less restricted, pumping-induced vertical gradients can more easily pull the interface upward (stronger deformation).",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — higher vertical conductivity facilitates vertical flow and interface deformation; it does not flatten the interface or remove density effects."
  },
  {
    "question": "In an unconfined coastal aquifer, which statement about pumping-induced drawdown and upconing is most consistent with a sharp-interface interpretation?",
    "options": {
      "Upconing depends only on the density difference and is independent of drawdown.": false,
      "Greater drawdown near the well generally increases the upward displacement of the interface and the risk of salinization.": true,
      "If recharge is constant, upconing cannot occur.": false,
      "Upconing can only occur when the coastline moves landward.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — larger drawdown increases vertical gradients near the well and tends to pull the interface upward, raising salinization risk.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — upconing is strongly linked to pumping-induced drawdown; constant recharge does not prevent interface deformation near the well."
