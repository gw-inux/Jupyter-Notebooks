    "question": "How does the Glover equation differ conceptually from the Ghyben–Herzberg relation?",
    "options": {
      "Glover describes the interface profile as a function of distance from the shoreline, whereas Ghyben–Herzberg gives only a local relation between head and interface depth at a point.": true,
      "Glover explicitly includes the freshwater discharge (or gradient) toward the sea, while Ghyben–Herzberg assumes purely hydrostatic equilibrium.": true,
      "Glover assumes a mixing zone of finite thickness, while Ghyben–Herzberg assumes a perfectly sharp interface.": false,
      "Glover can capture pumping-induced transients, while Ghyben–Herzberg is strictly a static equilibrium concept.": false
    },
    "success": "Correct — Glover extends Ghyben–Herzberg by describing the full interface profile along the coast and explicitly including the freshwater gradient/discharge.",
    "error": "Not quite — remember that Glover adds the horizontal flow field and interface shape along x, while Ghyben–Herzberg is a local static relation at a point."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the Glover formulation for a sharp interface in a coastal aquifer (no pumping), which of the following changes will tend to increase the inland extent or thickness of the freshwater body (all else equal)?",
    "options": {
      "Increasing the hydraulic gradient i (= increased freshwater flowing seaward).": true,
      "Increasing the aquifer thickness b.": true,
      "Decreasing the density difference (making seawater and freshwater more similar in density).": true,
      "Decreasing the freshwater discharge toward the sea.": false
    },
    "success": "Correct — stronger gradient, thicker aquifer and smaller density contrast all favour a more extensive/thicker freshwater body in the Glover framework.",
    "error": "Not quite — think about which changes strengthen the freshwater wedge compared to the saltwater body (more gradient, thicker aquifer, smaller density contrast)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following assumptions is true for the Glover (1959) solution?",
    "options": {
      "The interface between freshwater and saltwater is sharp and separates two regions of constant density.": true,
      "The aquifer is homogeneous, isotropic, of constant thickness, and satisfies the Dupuit (essentially horizontal flow) approximation.": true,
      "Seawater is static, and freshwater flows seaward under a constant hydraulic gradient.": true,
      "Vertical flow components and dispersion in the mixing zone are fully resolved in detail.": false
    },
    "success": "Correct — Glover assumes a sharp interface, constant densities, a homogeneous Dupuit aquifer of constant thickness, and steady freshwater flow toward a static sea.",
    "error": "Not quite — Glover is a sharp-interface, horizontally averaged, steady-state model and does not resolve vertical flow or dispersion in detail."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the steady-state Glover solution for a sharp freshwater–saltwater interface in a coastal aquifer (no pumping), which parameter change will increase the depth of the interface beneath the shoreline, without changing the aquifer thickness?",
    "options": {
      "Increasing the density difference between seawater and freshwater.": false,
      "Decreasing the freshwater hydraulic gradient i toward the sea.": false,
      "Increasing the freshwater hydraulic gradient i toward the sea.": true,
      "Decreasing the freshwater recharge so that the discharge to the sea becomes negligible.": false
    },
    "success": "Correct — increasing the freshwater hydraulic gradient strengthens seaward flow and pushes the interface deeper at the shoreline.",
    "error": "Not quite — in the Glover model, a stronger freshwater gradient deepens the interface at the coast; weaker gradients or negligible discharge do the opposite."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the Glover model, what is the key simplification made about groundwater flow in the freshwater zone?",
    "options": {
      "Flow is fully three-dimensional, with strong vertical components near the coast.": false,
      "Flow is mainly horizontal, so vertical gradients are neglected (Dupuit approximation).": true,
      "Flow is assumed to be zero everywhere; only diffusion is considered.": false,
      "Flow occurs only in the saltwater zone, while the freshwater is static.": false
    },
    "success": "Correct — Glover relies on the Dupuit approximation, assuming predominantly horizontal flow and neglecting vertical gradients in the freshwater zone.",
    "error": "Not quite — the model assumes mainly horizontal flow (Dupuit), not fully 3D flow or purely static conditions."
