    "question": "Which of the following effects are expected when sea level rises but recharge remains constant?",
    "options": {
      "The saltwater toe tends to move landward, reducing the width of the freshwater zone.": true,
      "The water table near the coast can rise, potentially increasing groundwater levels in low-lying areas.": true,
      "The aquifer’s freshwater volume may decrease, because a larger part of the aquifer cross-section is occupied by saltwater.": true,
      "The porosity n automatically decreases as sea level rises.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — sea-level rise with constant recharge typically drives the saltwater toe landward, can raise coastal water tables, and may reduce freshwater volume, but it does not change porosity.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — remember that sea-level rise mainly affects heads, toe position, and freshwater volume; porosity is a material property and does not automatically change."
  },
  {
    "question": "In this analytical sea-level rise framework, which statement best reflects how hydraulic conductivity K influences the response?",
    "options": {
      "Higher K (Aquifer B) allows freshwater to drain more efficiently toward the sea, so the relative inland movement of the saltwater toe for a given sea-level rise is generally smaller.": true,
      "Higher K always leads to a larger inland movement of the saltwater toe.": false,
      "The position of the saltwater toe does not depend on K at all.": false,
      "K only affects porosity and has no hydraulic significance in this model.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly — a higher K lets the aquifer adjust more easily, often reducing the relative inland intrusion for the same sea-level rise.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — think about how a more transmissive aquifer can more easily transmit freshwater seaward and resist intrusion for the same boundary change."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following management conclusions are consistent with what this analytical sea-level rise model can show?",
    "options": {
      "The use of a sharp interface and homogeneous conditions is sufficient for detailed management decisions.": false,
      "Even without pumping, sea-level rise alone can gradually reduce freshwater storage and move saltwater closer to existing wells.": true,
      "The analytical model should be used as a screening tool, and areas that appear highly vulnerable may warrant more detailed numerical modelling and field investigations.": true,
      "Low-lying, gently sloping coasts (small theta) are particularly vulnerable to inland movement of the saltwater wedge for a given sea-level rise.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — the model is best used as a screening tool to show that even without pumping, sea-level rise can reduce freshwater storage, especially along low-lying, gently sloping coasts.",
    "error": "❌ Almost — remember that the model is not sufficient for detailed site-scale decisions but is very useful for screening and identifying vulnerable settings."
  },
  {
    "question": "Two coastal aquifers are identical in all respects (recharge, K, densities, z0, L0, delta_z0) except for the slope of the coastline. Which statement is most consistent with the result of an analytical sea-level rise model?",
    "options": {
      "Both aquifers respond the same way; slope has no effect on seawater intrusion.": false,
      "The gently sloping Aquifer A is more vulnerable to inland migration of the saltwater wedge and loss of freshwater volume for the same sea-level rise.": true,
      "A steeper slope means greater landward intrusion because the interface is nearly vertical.": false,
      "The travel time at steeper coastlines are always longer and therefore result in greater saltwater intrusion.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — gentle slopes amplify the horizontal impact of sea-level rise, making inland intrusion and freshwater loss more severe in low-gradient settings.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — the key point is that gently sloping coasts are more sensitive; steep coasts typically show less inland movement for the same vertical rise."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which consequences of sea-level rise are likely to promote a landward movement of the freshwater–saltwater interface in an unpumped coastal aquifer?",
    "options": {
      "An increase in long-term recharge, which raises inland groundwater levels more than sea level.": false,
      "A decrease in seawater density, making seawater less dense than before.": false,
      "A landward shift of the coastline, which reduces the horizontal distance between the sea and the freshwater body.": true,
      "A rise in mean sea level that reduces the hydraulic gradient from land to sea, so less freshwater is discharged seaward.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — a landward-shifted coastline and a reduced land-to-sea gradient both favour landward intrusion of the saltwater wedge.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite — think about which changes physically move the sea closer to the freshwater body and weaken seaward freshwater flow."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why can sea-level rise lead to increased salinization risk of coastal groundwater resources even in the absence of pumping?",
    "options": {
      "Sea-level rise steepens the land-to-sea hydraulic gradient, increasing freshwater discharge.": false,
      "Sea-level rise raises the coastal boundary head, reducing the driving force for freshwater flow toward the sea.": true,
      "Sea-level rise increases dispersion and mixing automatically, regardless of aquifer properties.": false,
      "Sea-level rise can shift the freshwater–saltwater interface landward, bringing saltwater closer to wells and reducing freshwater storage.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — by raising coastal heads and shifting the interface landward, sea-level rise alone can increase salinization risk even without pumping.",
    "error": "❌ Remember that the key mechanism is the reduced seaward freshwater gradient and the landward shift of the interface, not automatic increases in dispersion."
