### 📘 Exercise – Comparing well designs and pumping strategies

🎯 Expected Learning Outcomes:

Completion of this exercise helps you to:

- Understand the main controls on the shape and inland extent of the freshwater–saltwater interface in a coastal aquifer.
- Visualise the freshwater–saltwater interface under different hydrological conditions.
- Assess how changes in a coastal area influence the **vulnerability of a coastal aquifer to saltwater intrusion**.

### 1. Coastal aquifer

The small coastal community relies almost entirely on a coastal aquifer for its drinking water. The town sits a few hundred metres inland from the shoreline, and the local water authority is worried that **future changes in recharge and sea level** could threaten their freshwater supply.
You have been asked to provide a **screening-level assessment** of the aquifer using the **Glover equation**. Although simplified, the **Glover equation** can give  a first idea of how robust the freshwater lens is under different conditions.

Local hydrogeologists have been estimated the following baseline values:

- Aquifer thickness: $b$ = 40 m)  
- Hydraulic gradient toward the sea: $i$ = 0.001)  
- Freshwater density: $\rho_f$ = 1000 kg/m^3)  
- Seawater density: $\rho_s$ = 1025 kg/m^3)

1. Plot the **freshwater–saltwater interface**. 
2. From the plot, estimate:
   - the **interface depth at the shoreline**,  
   - whether the interface reaches the **aquifer base** within 1000 m inland,  
   - the **overall shape** of the interface (nearly flat, gently curved, or strongly curved).  

### 2. A drier future – reduced recharge

Climate projections suggest that the region may experience **reduced recharge**, lowering the hydraulic gradient toward the sea.

1. Decrease the hydraulic gradient and re-plot the interface. 
2. Compare this “dry future” scenario to the baseline:
   - Is the interface at the shoreline **shallower or deeper**?  
   - Has the **saltwater toe** moved **further inland** or **further seaward**?  

👉 *Based on this, explain whether reduced recharge makes the aquifer **more or less vulnerable** to saltwater intrusion.*

### 3. Managed aquifer recharge – remediation possible?

The community is considering a **managed aquifer recharge (MAR)** project: capturing excess stormwater and infiltrating it inland to increase the freshwater gradient toward the sea
1. Increase the hydraulic gradient and re-plot the interface. 
2. Compare all three scenarios:
   - In which case is the **interface deepest at the shoreline**?
   - In which case is the **saltwater toe furthest seaward**?

### 4. Uncertainty – Influence of aquifer thickness?

The local hydrogeologists are still uncertain about the true thickness of the aquifer.
1. Keep the hydraulic gradient and the densities and explore the impact of aquifer thickness
2. Compare two scenarios:
    - How does the depth at the shoreline change 
    - How does the inland extent of the saltwater toe change

👉 Finally, reflect on the **limitations** of using the Glover equation: Which important processes and complexities are **not** represented (e.g. pumping, heterogeneity, mixing zone, transients)?
