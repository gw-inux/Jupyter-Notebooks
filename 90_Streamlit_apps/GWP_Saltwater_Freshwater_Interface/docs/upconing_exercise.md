### 📘 Exercise – Comparing well designs and pumping strategies

🎯 Expected Learning Outcomes:

Completion of this exercise helps you to accomplish the following.

- Understand how the hydrological conditions and pump design influence the risk of upconing
- Develop the knowledge to guide sustainable well-field design in coastal areas. 

A coastal water utility is planning to supply a small town using groundwater from an aquifer where saline water underlies freshwater. They are considering two alternative designs:

1. **Design A – One deep, high-capacity well**  
   - One fully penetrating well located close to the coast  
   - Screened close to the initial interface  
   - High pumping rate to meet the entire demand with a single well  

2. **Design B – Several shallower, lower-capacity wells**  
   - A cluster of wells further inland  
   - Each well has a shallower screen, farther above the interface  
   - Lower pumping rate per well, with the total demand shared between them  

Use the **upconing app** and explore how upconing under a single **deep, strongly pumped well** compares to that under **multiple shallow wells with lower pumping rates**.
Therefore systematically vary
  - pumping rate $Q$,
  - pre-pumping distance $d_{pre}$,
  - hydraulic conductivity $K$,
  - porosity $n$,
  - and density contrast $\Delta \rho$

and analyse how each affects the **maximum upconing at the well** and the **critical pumping rate**.
Discuss which design (A or B) is more robust against salinisation and under what conditions the difference between the designs becomes most pronounced.
