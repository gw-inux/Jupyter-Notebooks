### 📘 Exercise – Sea level rise

🎯 Expected Learning Outcomes:

Completion of this exercise helps you to:

- Use an analytical sea-level rise model to evaluate changes in water table, toe position and freshwater volume.
- Understand how coastal shapes and hydraulic properties influence the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to sea-level rise.
- Appreciate the role of shoreline retreat and recognise the limits of sharp-interface, homogeneous analytical models.

Two coastal municipalities, Harborville and Cliffside, pump almost no groundwater but rely on natural freshwater discharge from unconfined coastal aquifers to support wetlands and springs.
You will use the Sea Level Rise app to compare how sea-level rise affects:
	Water-table elevation
	Position of the saltwater toe
	Freshwater volume
in two idealised sloping aquifers.
Assume:
	Freshwater density: ρ_f=1000" 					" 〖"kg/m" 〗^3
	Seawater density: ρ_s=1025" 					" 〖"kg/m" 〗^3
	Initial aquifer base depth below sea level: z_0=40" m" 
	Initial aquifer width: L_0=2000" m" 
	Recharge: W=0.0005" m/d" (≈ 180 mm/year)
	Porosity: n=0.25
	Sea-level rise: Δz_0=+0.6" m" 
Harborville – low-lying, gently sloping coast
	Aquifer slope: θ=1^∘
	Hydraulic conductivity: K=20" m/d" 
Cliffside – steeper, more transmissive coast
	Aquifer slope: θ=5^∘
	Hydraulic conductivity: K=50" m/d" 

1. Baseline comparison (before sea-level rise)
	Set Δz_0=0(no sea-level rise) and compute, for Harborville and Cliffside separately:
	Water-table profile h_0 (x)
	Initial toe position x_T0
	Initial freshwater volume V_0(per unit width).
	Compare the two aquifers:
	Which has a wider freshwater zone (toe further inland)?
	Which has a thicker freshwater body near the coast?
Write 3–4 sentences explaining how slope and K influence the baseline freshwater configuration.

2. Apply sea-level rise
Now set Δz_0=+0.6" m" for both aquifers.
	For Harborville and Cliffside, determine:
	New toe position x_Ttand toe shift Δx_T
	Change in freshwater volume ΔV
	Change in water-table height near the coastline.
	Compare:
	In which aquifer is the toe migration inland larger?
	In which aquifer is the relative loss of freshwater volume (ΔV/V_0) greater?
👉 Write a short paragraph answering:
Which town is more vulnerable to sea-level-rise–driven intrusion in this model, and why?
Focus on the roles of coastal slope and K.

3. “What if” scenario – adding shoreline retreat (Harborville)
Sea-level rise is often accompanied by shoreline retreat (erosion), effectively moving the coastline landward relative to the aquifer.
	For Harborville only, simulate a simple shoreline retreat by reducing the effective aquifer width from
L_0=2000" mto" L_t=1800" m" 

while keeping Δz_0=+0.6" m" and the same slope.
	Recalculate toe position and freshwater volume.
	Answer briefly:
	How does reducing L_0change the toe position compared to the case with the same sea-level rise but no shoreline retreat?
	Why does coastline retreat further increase vulnerability beyond the effect of sea-level rise alone?

4. Management reflection
In 4–6 sentences:
	Summarise the main differences in response between Harborville and Cliffside (low slope–moderate Kvs. steeper–higher K).
	Discuss one possible adaptation strategy for each town based on what the model shows (e.g. land-use planning in low-lying zones, monitoring wells, protecting recharge areas, considering MAR).
	List two limitations of using this analytical sea-level rise model as the sole basis for planning (e.g. no pumping, sharp interface, homogeneous aquifer, no 3D salinity structure, no explicit infrastructure).
