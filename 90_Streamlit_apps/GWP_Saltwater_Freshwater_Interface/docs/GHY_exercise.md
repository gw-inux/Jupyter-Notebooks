### 📘 Exercise – Sharp freshwater saltwater interface

🎯 Expected Learning Outcomes:

Completion of this exercise helps you to:

-Estimate the freshwater saltwater interface depth for simple coastal settings.
-Understand how small changes in freshwater head can cause large changes in freshwater thickness.
-Reflect on the limitations of a local head-depth relation.

1. Coastal aquifer

The small coastal community relies on shallow hand-dug wells in the centre of the island. Recent years have brought:
- Several droughts (reduced rainfall and recharge), and
- Construction of new guesthouses that increase water demand.

Use the Ghyben–Herzberg relation to explore how sensitive the freshwater lens is to changes in water table elevation and to discuss sustainable use.
1. Present situation – “normal” recharge
	In the app, set a representative freshwater head at the island centre, e.g.
h=1.0" m above mean sea level" 

	Use the Ghyben–Herzberg app to:
	Compute and visualise the interface depth at the island centre.

2. Drought scenario – reduced recharge
Now simulate a multi-year drought where recharge is significantly reduced and the water table drops.
	Reduce the water table to, for example,
h=0.5" m above sea level" 

	Recalculate in the app and compare:
	By how many metres has the interface moved upward at the island centre?
	
3. Human pressure – adding a pumping well
A guesthouse wants to install a new shallow pumping well near the island centre.
	Assume the well is screened in the upper part of the freshwater lens and that pumping will induce an additional local drawdown of 0.3 m at the centre of the island during peak season.
	In the app, further reduce hat the centre by 0.3 m on top of the drought scenario (e.g. from 0.5 m to 0.2 m).
	Evaluate:
	What is the new interface depth?
	How much of the original freshwater thickness (from Part 1) remains?

4. Critical thinking – where Ghyben–Herzberg fails
Finally, discuss briefly:
	Which key processes and complexities are not represented in the Ghyben–Herzberg approach for this island? (Think: lateral flow, dispersion/mixing zone, dynamic effects near the shore, local heterogeneity, pollution, storm overwash, etc.)
	Why might the true interface depth differ from the Ghyben–Herzberg prediction near the shoreline?
