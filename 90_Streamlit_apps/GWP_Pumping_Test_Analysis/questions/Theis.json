    "question": "What type of aquifer and conditions does the original Theis (1935) solution describe?",
    "options": {
      "A) Steady-state flow in confined aquifer": false,
      "B) Transient flow in confined aquifer": true,
      "C) Transient flow in unconfined aquifer": false,
      "D) Steady-state flow in leaky aquifer": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. The Theis solution is for transient flow in a fully confined aquifer.",
    "error": "❌ Incorrect. Remember that the original Theis formulation was considered for confined aquifers under transient flow."

    "question": "Which parameters are estimated by fitting Theis curves to drawdown data?",

      "C) Specific yield and porosity": false,
      "D) Recharge rate and well efficiency": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Fitting Theis curves yields transmissivity (T) and storativity (S).",

    "question": "What is the mathematical form of the Theis solution?",
    "options": {

      "D) s(r,t) = T/S * r": false
    },

    "question": "How does transmissivity (T) affect the cone of depression shape?",

      "A) Higher T → narrower and deeper cone": false,

      "C) Lower T → broader and shallower cone": false,
      "D) T does not affect the cone of depression": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. High transmissivity spreads drawdown more broadly with less depth near the well.",

      "C) The thickness of the aquifer": false,
      "D) The well efficiency": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. S quantifies how much water is released or stored due to head change.",
    "error": "❌ Incorrect. Transmission is controlled by T, not S."

      "B) Semi-log plot": true,
      "C) Arithmetic plot": false,
      "D) Histogram": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Late-time drawdown vs. log(time) is linear.",
    "error": "❌ Incorrect. The straight-line method is based on semi-log behavior."

    "question": "What does a mismatch between Theis curve and late-time field data often indicate?",

      "A) Constant pumping rate": false,

      "C) Measurement accuracy was too high": false,
      "D) Theis curve is only valid for steady state": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Deviation at late time often reflects leakage or boundaries.",
    "error": "❌ Incorrect. Recall that Theis assumptions exclude leakage and boundaries."

    "question": "What is the purpose of the scatter plot with a 45° line in the app?",
    "options": {
      "A) To show the pumping rate trend": false,

      "C) To verify aquifer thickness": false,
      "D) To compute storativity directly": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Points along the 45° line indicate a good match.",
    "error": "❌ Incorrect. The scatter plot is for fit evaluation, not aquifer thickness."

    "question": "Why is it not possible to obtain a perfect fit of Theis solution to field data?",
    "options": {
      "A) Pumping rates are never exactly constant": true,

      "D) Evapotranspiration and external stresses may distort signals": true
