            The Hantush-Jacob (1955) solution is intended to evaluate pumping tests in semiconfined settings.
            
            This application uses the Hantush-Jacob solution to estimate Transmissivity $T$ and  Storativity $S$ of an aquifer, as well as the leakage factor $r/B$ related to aquitard properties, from drawdown data collected during a pumping test.
            
            You can estimate $T$, $S$, and $r/B$ by adjusting the sliders to modify the parameter values until the measured data align with the Hantush-Jacob curve for the input parameters. _B_ is a parameter that reflects the inverse of the potential for aquitard leakage _b'/K'_ relative to the ability of the aquifer to transmit groundwater laterally $T$. There is greater leakage potential for a smaller value of B which reflects a thinner aquitard of higher conductivity, that is, there is more potential leakage through an aquitard with a smaller ratio of _b'_ to _K'_.

            In this section, you can **adjust the values of transmissivity, storativity, and $r/B$ until the curve of drawdown versus time that is calculated and plotted on the graph matches the measured data from the Viterbo test site in Italy**. The match indicates that the selected values are a reasonable representation of the aquifer properties.
            
            The lower aquifer is 9 meters thick and is overlain by an aquitard that is 11 m thick that separates the lower Varnum Aquifer from an overlying aquifer. When the Varnum Aquifer is pumped, water leaks downward from the overlying aquifer in response to the lowered head in the Varnum Aquifer.
        
            After estimating the parameter values that result in a good fit of the Hantush-Jacob curve to the data, and knowing the thickness of the aquitard, the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is calculated.
