    "question": "What distinguishes a Multi-Node Well (MNW) from a standard WEL in MODFLOW? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) MNW can connect to multiple model cells": true,
      "B) MNW supports head-dependent flow": true,
      "C) WEL can simulate variable conductance": false,
      "D) MNW supports physical and operational constraints": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — MNW offers advanced features like head-dependency and constraints across nodes.",
    "error": "❌ MNW goes beyond WEL by allowing flow to multiple cells and applying head-based conditions."

    "question": "Which of the following are head-related constraints used in MNW simulations? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Maximum drawdown": true,
      "B) Constant recharge rate": false,
      "C) Pumping limits (Qmax)": true,
      "D) Minimum cell thickness": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. MNW can enforce pumping constraints based on head or capacity.",
    "error": "❌ Head constraints and pumping limits are central to MNW, not recharge or thickness."

    "question": "What behavior can be observed in Q–h plots for MNW? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) A horizontal line representing the aquifer (cell) head": true,
      "B) A slope representing head-dependent flow into the well": true,
      "C) Negative flows when head drops below zero": false,
      "D) A horizontal line representing the well head": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. MNW plots combine diagonal lines representing head-dependent flow with horizontal lines representing specified flow boundaries.",
    "error": "❌ Look closely — MNW plots different characteristics reflecting the aquifer(cell) head and the well head."

  {
    "question": "Why might an MNW stop pumping during a simulation? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Head drops below the pump intake": true,
      "B) Conductance becomes negative": false,
      "C) The maximum pumping rate is exceeded": true,
      "D) The aquifer goes dry": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes — dry cells, limits, or heads below constraints can all trigger pump shutdown.",
    "error": "❌ MNW simulates physical well behavior, including limits that can shut off flow."
