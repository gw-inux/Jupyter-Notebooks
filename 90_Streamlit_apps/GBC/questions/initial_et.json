    "question": "What does the ET boundary condition in MODFLOW simulate? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Loss of water from the water table due to plant uptake and evaporation": true,
      "B) River infiltration": false,
      "C) Recharge from rainfall": false,
      "D) Head-dependent discharge from shallow groundwater": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. ET simulates shallow groundwater losses via evapotranspiration.",

    "question": "At what condition is the actual ET rate equal to the potential ET rate? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) When the water table is at or above the ET surface": true,
      "B) When the water table is below the extinction depth": false,
      "C) When the aquifer is fully saturated": false,
      "D) When the drawdown is zero": false

      "A) It decreases linearly until the extinction depth is reached": true,

      "C) It stays constant": false,
      "D) It stops when water table falls below the extinction depth": true
    },

    "error": "❌ The ET rate drops linearly with depth until it reaches zero."

    "question": "What does the extinction depth represent? (Mark ALL correct answers)",

      "A) Maximum rooting depth where plants can still access groundwater": true,

      "C) Minimum saturated thickness": false,
      "D) Depth at which recharge occurs": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. The extinction depth defines the lower limit for ET activity.",
    "error": "❌ Extinction depth is a plant-access limit, not a structural boundary."
