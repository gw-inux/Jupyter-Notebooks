    "question": "Under which condition is the flow through the river boundary considered 'constant' (i.e., flow is not depended from aquifer head)? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) When aquifer head is lower than river bottom elevation": true,
      "B) When river stage is below river bottom": false,
      "C) When aquifer head equals river bottom elevation": false,
      "D) When the riverbed conductance is zero": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Constant flow occurs if the aquifer is below the river bottom.",
    "error": "❌ Recheck when MODFLOW define flow to a fixed value — it depends on aquifer heads."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when the aquifer head is higher than the river stage and both are above the river bottom? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The river recharges the aquifer": false,
      "B) The aquifer discharges into the river": true,
      "C) Flow is proportional to conductance and head difference": true,
      "D) No flow occurs in this condition": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. This is a typical 'losing river' case, where the aquifer discharges to the river.",
    "error": "❌ Flow direction depends on the relative heads — think of which side is higher."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following factors influence the maximum flow from river to aquifer in MODFLOW’s RIV package? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The river stage": true,
      "B) The aquifer head": true,
      "C) The river bottom elevation": true,
      "D) The riverbed conductance": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. All four parameters affect the flow. Conductance scales the head difference, and the bottom acts as a lower bound.",
    "error": "❌ All listed parameters are involved in determining flow magnitude and direction."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a scenario where the riverbed conductance is low, what is the expected behavior? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Very little flow between river and aquifer": true,
      "B) Flow increases sharply with small head differences": false,
      "C) The Q–h curve is steep": false,
      "D) The exchange flux is small even with large head differences": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. A low conductance limits the flow, resulting in a flat Q–h slope.",
    "error": "❌ Review the role of conductance — it determines the ease of flow across the interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does MODFLOW limit river recharge below the river bottom? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It prevents unrealistic downward seepage from the river": true,
      "B) Because the model assumes river water can only infiltrate to the depth of the riverbed": true,
      "C) To maintain a constant conductance value independent of head conditions": false,
	  "D) Because the river cell becomes inactive when the aquifer head drops below the riverbed": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. MODFLOW restricts river recharge below the bottom to reflect physical limitations.",
    "error": "❌ The restriction is due to physical representation, it is not related to conductance nor do river cells become inactive."
  },
  {
    "question": "When the aquifer head equals the river stage, and both are above the bottom, what is the flow? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Zero": true,
      "B) Maximum": false,
      "C) Depends on conductance": false,
      "D) Depends on river bottom elevation": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. No flow occurs when heads are equal — the system is balanced.",
    "error": "❌ Think of the head difference — if it's zero, the driving force is also zero."
