    "question": "Which statements describe how a General Head Boundary (GHB) behaves? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The flow direction depends on the difference between $H_B$ and $h_{aq}$.": true,
      "B) A GHB always enforces a constant discharge.": false,
      "C) A GHB allows variable inflow and outflow.": true,
      "D) GHBs are only used at the top of the model.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. GHBs simulate dynamic exchange driven by head differences.",
    "error": "❌ GHBs allow variable flow and are not restricted to a model's top layer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which expression correctly defines the flow across a GHB? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) $Q_B = C_B(H_B - h_{aq})$": true,
      "B) $Q_B = K (H_B - h_{aq})$": false,
      "C) $Q_B = C_B h_{aq}$": false,
      "D) $Q_B = H_B / C_B$": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. The GHB flow equation linearly links flow to the head difference.",
    "error": "❌ Review the GHB equation. It's based on conductance and the head difference."

  {
    "question": "What happens when the aquifer head $h_{aq}$ equals the boundary head $H_B$? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The flow $Q_B$ becomes zero.": true,
      "B) The boundary acts as a recharge zone.": false,
      "C) The flow direction reverses.": false,
      "D) The conductance drops to zero.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. When heads equalize, there is no driving force for flow.",
    "error": "❌ No head difference means no flow across the boundary."
  },
  {
    "question": "Increasing the conductance $C_B$ in a GHB has which effects? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Increases flow for the same head difference.": true,
      "B) Changes the direction of flow.": false,
      "C) Increases the slope of the Q–h plot.": true,
      "D) Alters the external boundary head $H_B$.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes. Conductance controls the steepness of the Q–h relation and flow magnitude.",
    "error": "❌ Conductance does not affect flow direction or boundary head directly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which parameters jointly control the flow through a GHB? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Boundary head $H_B$": true,
      "B) Aquifer head $h_{aq}$": true,
      "C) Recharge applied elsewhere in the model": false,
      "D) Conductance $C_B$": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Flow is governed by conductance and the head difference.",
    "error": "❌ Recharge affects heads, but not directly the GHB flow equation."

    "question": "When is a GHB considered 'gaining' from the aquifer's perspective? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) When $H_B > h_{aq}$": true,
      "B) When $h_{aq} > H_B$": false,
      "C) When $Q_B < 0$": false,
      "D) When flow enters the aquifer": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. The GHB adds water to the aquifer when its head is higher.",
    "error": "❌ A gaining boundary means water flows into the aquifer from the boundary."
