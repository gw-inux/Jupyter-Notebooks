    "question": "Which of the following processes describe how rivers can interact with groundwater? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A river can gain water from the aquifer.": true,
      "A river can lose water to the aquifer.": true,
      "A river always maintains a fixed exchange rate with the aquifer.": false,
      "A river can maintain a fixed exchange rate if the aquifer head falls too low.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. River–aquifer interaction can include gaining, losing, and drying scenarios.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices were incorrect. A river may gain, lose, or interact with a fixed exchange rate depending on the hydraulic gradient and bed elevation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What physical property controls the rate of exchange between river and aquifer? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "River conductance": true,
      "River width": true,
      "Aquifer porosity": false,
      "Difference between river stage and aquifer head": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Right. The conductance and head difference control the exchange flow.",
    "error": "❌ The correct factors include river conductance, river geometry, and the hydraulic gradient."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the groundwater level falls below the riverbed bottom in a RIV boundary? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "The flow from river to aquifer continues as before.": false,
      "The flow becomes zero.": false,
      "The river is assumed dry at that location.": false,
      "A constant flow into the aquifer is applied instead.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. Once the aquifer head drops below the riverbed bottom, flow is halted in MODFLOW’s RIV package.",
    "error": "❌ In MODFLOW, the RIV boundary cuts off flow if the aquifer is below the riverbed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What distinguishes the RIV boundary from the General Head Boundary (GHB)? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "RIV includes a physical cutoff when the aquifer head is below the riverbed.": true,
      "RIV allows flow in both directions.": false,
      "RIV is independent of aquifer properties.": false,
      "RIV uses stage, bed elevation, and conductance to control flow.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. The RIV boundary introduces a cutoff not present in GHB and considers bed elevation.",
    "error": "❌ RIV flow includes a physical check on the aquifer level and uses river stage and bed elevation."
