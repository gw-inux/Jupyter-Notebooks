    "success": "✅ Correct! Lower $C_{Riv}$ increases the resistance between the aquifer model and the boundary, thus the aquifer heads must be higher to drive the same volume of water out of the boundary. Lowering  $K$ increases overall resistance of the aquifer requiring a steeper gradient and thus higher heads to discharge the same volume of water to the river",
    "error": "❌ Not correct. Increasing hydraulic conductivity or conductance reduces the resistance to flow and therefore also heads."
