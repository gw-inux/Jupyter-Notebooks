#### üí° Motivation and Introduction

- Why does water cling to tiny pores in soil and resist gravity?  
- What makes sandy soils drain quickly while clay holds on to every drop?  
- How can we translate invisible capillary forces into meaningful quantities for water management?

This section of the module covers the physics behind water in unsaturated soils. You‚Äôll explore how surface tension, wettability, and capillary pressure shape the movement and retention of water ‚Äî and why these principles are foundational in hydrology, agriculture, and groundwater modeling. By understanding these mechanisms, you‚Äôll be better equipped to predict infiltration, plant water availability, and the impact of soil texture on water storage and movement within the **unsaturates zone**.

In contrast to the *Saturated Zone*, where the porous medium is fully saturated with a single fluid of uniform properties (density, viscosity, and composition), the **Unsaturated Zone** contains‚Äîat least‚Äîtwo immiscible fluids that coexist: a wetting and non-wetting, such as water and air, respectively (**Figure 1a**). As shown in **Figure 1b**, the moisture content in the *Unsaturated Zone* is therefore less than 100%. The pressure head under saturated conditions is greater than zero, equal to zero at the groundwater table, and negative in the unsaturated zone (**Figure 1c**).

        A **decrease in meniscus radius** ($r$) corresponds to an **increase in capillary pressure** ($P_{c}$): when a water-saturated soil drains, the water retreats into **smaller pores**, where it is held more tightly. This happens because **smaller pores have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio**, meaning a greater proportion of the water is in contact with the solid surface. This amplifies surface tension effects, resulting in **stronger capillary forces** that resist gravity-driven drainage. On the other hand, an **increase in meniscus radius** corresponds to a **decrease in capillary pressure**: during imbibition, the wetting fluid advances into larger pores and displaces a nonwetting fluid by capillary forces alone. 
        
        The curvature of each meniscus reflects the local capillary pressure, which depends on the size and shape of the pore ‚Äî the smallest radius of curvature occurs in the narrowest pores. As a result, draining smaller pores requires higher capillary pressures (more negative), while larger pores drain at lower capillary pressures. 
     
        When no water is entering or leaving the system, **capillary forces continue to act**: they pull water into and retain it within smaller pores. In fact, the **capillary suction in these fine pores is strong enough to hold the water against gravity**, which is why water can remain suspended in the soil even after drainage has stopped. Capillary pressure stops moving water upward into smaller pores when the capillary potential is balanced by other forces, primarily gravitational potential and matric potential.
            
        The relationship between the capillary pressure and saturations of two fluid phases that occupy the pores in the unsaturated zone, is known as the **retention curve**.

        Retention curves‚Äîalso known as capillary pressure curves‚Äîare graphical representations of the relationship between soil saturation and capillary pressure, showing how water is retained in the soil by capillary forces against gravity. Their shape depends on the soil material and the initial water distribution. These graphs show that as saturation decreases (such as during drainage), capillary pressure increases, which leads to a decrease in the interfacial surface area. On the other hand, when saturation increases (such as during imbibition), capillary pressure decreases, resulting in an increase in the interfacial surface area. 
        
        In **Figure 5**, we summarize some of the key concepts that retention curves can describe. The horizontal axis represents the **saturation level** (or **volumetric water content**) of the soil ($\\theta_{w}$), and the vertical axis shows the **capillary pressure head** ($h_{c}$). The two curves represent two different types of soil: a well-graded (heterogeneous) soil and a poorly-graded (homogeneous) soil.
        
         Point A on the poorly-graded soil curve indicates the **threshold capillary pressure head**‚Äîalso known as the **entry pressure**. This represents the minimum pressure required for a non-wetting fluid (e.g., air or oil) to begin displacing the wetting fluid (typically water) and enter the largest pores of the soil once it has reached equilibrium in the process of drainage from saturation. As shown, this threshold can be reached with only a slight reduction in water content. The region between the water table (where capillary pressure is zero) and the point defined by the entry pressure is known as the **capillary fringe** (see also Figure 1a). This zone is nearly saturated, but the water is under negative pressure (suction).

This point is quantified through laboratory experiments and is typically set at around ‚Äì100 to ‚Äì300 cm of pressure head‚Äîabout -1/10 to -1/3 bar (**Figure 6**). The **wilting point** is the water content at which plants can no longer extract water from the soil, typically around ‚Äì15000 cm of pressure head‚Äîalthough this value can vary depending on the plant species.

        Different behaviors in interfacial tension and wettability can occur during drainage or imbibition on a solid surface. These pore-scale processes can result in different retention curves for the same soil. A soil that starts fully saturated and undergoes drainage may exhibit a different retention curve than if that same soil starts completely dry and gradually becomes saturated during the imbibition process. As a result, we can observe different water contents for the same pressure value in the same soil, depending on the process the soil is undergoing. This phenomenon is known as **hysteresis**.
