# --- MOTIVATION ---
st.markdown("""
#### üí° Motivation - Why it matters
Saltwater Intrusion in Coastal Aquifers
Coastal aquifers are vital freshwater sources for millions of people worldwide. These underground reservoirs supply drinking water, support agriculture, and sustain ecosystems. However, their delicate balance is increasingly under threat from a range of environmental and human-induced pressures:

* Overpumping ‚Äì Excessive groundwater extraction lowers freshwater pressure, allowing denser seawater to migrate inland.

* Sea-level rise ‚Äì Higher ocean levels push the freshwater‚Äìsaltwater interface further into the aquifer.

* Climate change ‚Äì Altered rainfall patterns and prolonged droughts reduce aquifer recharge, intensifying the risk of intrusion.

* Storm surges and extreme weather ‚Äì Coastal flooding events can rapidly accelerate saltwater migration.

* Man-made infrastructure ‚Äì Canals and drainage systems may inadvertently act as conduits for saltwater movement.

These factors can cause the saltwater‚Äìfreshwater interface to migrate landward, contaminating wells and reducing water supply reliability‚Äîa process known as saltwater intrusion.

Saltwater intrusion is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers, typically occurring in coastal areas due to the natural hydraulic connection between groundwater and seawater. Under normal conditions, freshwater flows toward the sea, creating a pressure barrier that keeps saltwater at bay. But when this balance is disrupted, saltwater can encroach laterally or vertically into the aquifer, degrading groundwater quality and making it unsuitable for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use.

#### üö® Why Study It?

Understanding and predicting saltwater intrusion is critical for sustainable water management in coastal regions. Without proactive monitoring and modeling, communities risk:

üö± Water supply contamination, requiring costly treatment or alternative sources.

üåæ Agricultural damage, as saline water harms crops and soil health.

üèôÔ∏è Infrastructure challenges, including well abandonment and land-use restrictions.

üí∞ Economic strain, from mitigation efforts and loss of water-dependent industries.
                        
Therefore, understanding and predicting saltwater intrusion is critical for sustainable water management in coastal regions.

In coastal aquifers, freshwater from the land naturally ‚Äúfloats‚Äù above denser saltwater from the sea, creating an 
interface zone. Under undisturbed conditions, the two systems remain in balance. When that balance is disturbed‚Äîby 
pumping, recharge changes, or sea-level rise‚Äîthe saltwater front can move inland, threatening freshwater supplies.

#### üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. **Explain the physical principles governing freshwater‚Äìsaltwater distribution.**

2. **Apply key analytical models (e.g., Ghyben‚ÄìHerzberg, Glover‚ÄìMorgan) to estimate interface depth and movement.**

3. **Evaluate how pumping, recharge changes, and sea-level rise affect the position of the freshwater‚Äìsaltwater interface.**

4. **Interpret and use model results for informed groundwater management decisions.**
