Flow or movement laws allow the determination of production and loss rates in a balance equation. \rProcess quantification is thus based on\rbalance equations and \rlow/movement laws.\rThere are two important basic types of flow or movement laws in water management:\r\"Convection type\u201c\r\"Diffusion type\u201c\rIn addition, there is a mixed form in the spread of dissolved substances in porous media. Frequently, both basic types act simultaneously on spreading processes (superposition). Initially, the above-mentioned basic types are treated separately.\r\rIn the example (blue box / green arrow) it is important to acknowledge that several motion respectively flow processes occur\rgroundwater flow is described by the concept of diffusion\rdriven by gradient\rwithin a stationary medium (here the aquifer)\rtracer transport is described by the concept of advection (dispersion also occurs but can be neglected for that example)\rflow (transport) with the bulk movement of the carrying medium\rthe carrying medium in that case is the groundwater (whereas groundwater flow \u2013 as mentioned \u2013 is described by the concept of diffusion)"
