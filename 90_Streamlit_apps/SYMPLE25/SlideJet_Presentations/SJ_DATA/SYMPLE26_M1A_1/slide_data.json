In this case the well known relationship \u0394M = \uf072\u00b7\u0394V holds and each equation given above can be directly transformed into the other one.\rIf density changes have to be considered (e.g. for gas flow), the mass budget equation remains valid but the volume budget equation must be modified because \u0394M = \uf072\u00b7\u0394V + \u0394\uf072\u00b7V with \u0394\uf072 = change in density.\rCases with changing density have proven to be more easily tractable if the mass budget equation is used."
