By simulating a simple 1D unconfined aquifer with recharge and various boundary types, users of this module can gain insight into the essential principles that govern groundwater model boundaries and their practical implications in tools like the numerical groundwater flow model MODFLOW.

To support the understanding, this üìï :red[**Introduction**] part of the module applies well-known analytical solutions for 1D unconfined groundwater flow with recharge. It illustrates how different boundary types like specified head, specified flow, and head-dependent flux influence the resulting hydraulic head and flow distribution.

The subsequent parts of this module provide more details about specific boundary conditions with a focus on MODFLOW, namely the general head (:orange[**GHB**]), river (:violet[**RIV**]), drain (:green[**DRN**]), multi-node-well (:grey[**MNW**]), and evapotranspiration (:blue[**EVT**]) boundary conditions.

The shapes of these volumes vary by model code. For some methods the hydraulic head $h$ is computed at the centroid of each volume as in the block-centered finite difference method of the original MODFLOW88 or at the intersection of volume sides as in finite element method of SUTRA ([Voss et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.3133/tm6A63)). For each volume, the models require geometry, hydraulic properties (e.g., $K$ and $S_S$ in the equation above), and boundary conditions (e.g., the term $W$ in the equation above).

    **A well** specifies a volumetric flow rate, an abstraction well removes water(-) and an injection well supplies water(+).

    Thus, recharge and wells can be assigned to the same cell. Their flow rates are summed to obtain a net flow rate.
    
    Specified heads and specified flows represent **boundary conditions** *(more explanation about boundary conditions follows in the subsequently part of this section)*. Since both the Specified head and Specified flux boundary conditions are easier to implement in the matrix equations, **this module focuses on the more complicated head-dependent flux boundary condition** packages of MODFLOW. These head-dependent flux packages add terms to both the matrix $[A]$ and the right-hand side vector $\{Q\}$ at each cell, or element, where a boundary condition is applied.  There are different packages in MODFLOW that apply to different types of head-dependent flux boundary conditions. Some supply volumetric rates by multiplying a flux [L/T] and an area [L¬≤], and some supply volumetric rates [L¬≥/T] directly.

#### üìä Types of Boundary Conditions in Groundwater Modeling and Q-h plots for description
In groundwater flow modeling, boundary conditions define how water enters, exits, or is prevented from flowing across a model surface. Understanding the different types of boundary conditions, and how they control the relationship between flow rate (_Q_) and hydraulic head (_h_), is essential for setting up realistic models and interpreting system behavior.

A **_Q_‚Äì_h_ plot** represents conditions at the location of the assigned boundary. It is a graphic display of the relationship between flow _Q_ and hydraulic head _h_, illustrating how a boundary responds to changes in model parameters and hydraulic conditions. Thus, a **_Q_‚Äì_h_ plot** shows what happens at the boundary.

Additional, excellent discussion of boundary conditions is provided by [T.E. Reilly (2001)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/twri/twri-3_B8/pdf/twri_3b8.pdf).

with st.expander("Show more :blue[**explanation about the boundary condition types**]"):
    st.markdown("""
    Groundwater models use different boundary condition types to represent different hydrological conditions. Each type defines a specific way that flow and head interact at the boundary, reflecting the physical behavior of the natural or engineered system. **The different types of boundaries and associated _Q_‚Äì_h_ plots** can be investigated by scrolling down to the Computation and Visualization section of this introduction and using the two example configurations of a one-dimensional unconfined aquifer (:green[**Scenario 1**] and :red[**Scenario 2**]). First, each type of boundary is described here.
    
    #### TYPE I. Specified Head Boundary (Dirichlet condition)
    
    **Definition:** For the analytical 1-D solution illustrated in this introductory section, hydraulic head is fixed at a specific value on one, or both, of the lateral boundaries. The flow across the boundary is proportional to the difference between the aquifer head $h_{aq}$ at the boundary and an external water level $h_{bc}$. The specified head represents the stage of an incised waterbody such as a river or lake. The aquifer hydraulic conductivity controls the flux across the boundary in response to the head difference $h_{aq}$-$h_{bc}$.
    
    In a numerical code, hydraulic head can be specified in any node in a cell or element. It is then input to the system of equations described in the previous drop-down section "Show more :blue[background about the mathematical application of boundary conditions in models]". With the head specified, the flow in or out of each side of the cell is calculated using the conductance across each side of the cell based on the effective hydraulic conductivity between the adjacent cells and the gradient determined by the specified head and the head in the adjacent cell which is determined by the model simulation. The most common package of **MODFLOW** for specifying a head is the **Time Variant Specified Head package CHD**.
    
    **Effect:** Using a specified head boundary simplifies the representation of the field system by imposing the average head of a water body at its location in the model. This can be more or less appropriate depending on the system. It is more appropriate for representing a strong external control like a large river or lake, or an ocean. It is less appropriate for representing a small water body that cannot provide/receive water to/from the groundwater system without experiencing a water level change. It is also not appropriate for representing a water body that has a low hydraulic conductivity bed that provides resistance to flow. 
    
    The specified head boundary serves as an unlimited sink/source of water. For example, if a high-capacity pumping well was placed in a model next to a specified head boundary, that boundary condition would provide the  inflow required to satisfy the pumping well without the head changing at the boundary regardless of the flow rate through the boundary.
    
    **Example application of a TYPE I boundary in the scenarios with interactive plots:**
    - :green[**Scenario 1**]: The right boundary (_x_ = _L_) has a specified head of 150 m.
    - :red[**Scenario 2**]: The right boundary (_x_ = _L_) has a specified head of 150 m. The left boundary (_x_ = _0_) has a user-defined specified head that can range between 145 m and 155 m.
    
    #### TYPE II. Specified-Flow Boundary (Neumann condition)
    **Definition:** For the analytical 1-D solution illustrated in this introductory section, a specified flow of water crosses the top boundary. The specified flow represents recharge, which is water that infiltrates to the water table. The recharge rate is provided and multiplied by the surface area to obtain the volumetric inflow rate. Head in the aquifer adjusts to accommodate the recharge and depending on the aquifer hydraulic conductivity and conditions at the other boundaries. :green[Scenario 1] includes another specified-flow boundary that is a special case of a specified-flow boundary, a no-flow boundary, with zero flow normal to the boundary. This can represent an impermeable material or a hydraulic groundwater divide that does not shift in response to model conditions. 
    
    For a three-dimensional numerical model such as a MODFLOW block-centered-flow formulation, a specified flow of water [L¬≥/T] can be assigned to any cell. It is input to the right-hand side vector $\{Q\}$ in the system of equations described in the previous drop-down section "Show more :blue[background about the mathematical application of boundary conditions in models]". Typically, model software provides options for assigning specified fluxes to a numerical model cell. In MODFLOW, a method for representing wells allows specifying the $q$ for each well in a cell, then summing the $q$‚Äôs and placing the net $q$ in the right-hand side vector for that cell. Another method for assigning flux is used to represent recharge. This allows assignment of a rate [L/T] that is multiplied by the area of the top of the cell then summing it with other fluxes applied to that cell and placing the net $q$ in the right-hand side vector for that cell.
    
    **Effect 1:** A specified flux boundary can represent recharge where flow across the model surface enters (or exits for a negative recharge rate such as for evapotranspiration in the 1-D analytical solution shown in this section). The system and heads within the aquifer rise or fall depending on the specified flow rate. For three-dimensional numerical models specified flows can be assigned to the top of a cell to represent recharge or within a cell to represent a pumping or injection well.
    
    **Effect 2:** If the rate is specified as zero, then water cannot flow into or out of the system across that boundary of the analytical model. Usually, the default is for all external boundaries to be no-flow, unless the modeler specifies differently. For a three-dimensional numerical model, no-flow is often accomplished by indicating that a cell is inactive and this can be done for any cell in the model. For example, there can be an impermeable zone in the middle of a model domain. A no-flow condition can be achieved in the flow-equation formulation by setting the hydraulic conductivity to zero.
    
    **Example application in the subsequent interactive plots:**
    - :green[**Scenario 1**]: The left boundary (_x_ = 0) is a no-flow boundary, simulating an impermeable barrier. The recharge on the top is a specified flow boundary at a rate that can be adjusted by the user.
    - :red[**Scenario 2**]: In this scenario, the only specified flow boundary is the top and the rate can be adjusted by the user.
    
    #### TYPE III. Head-Dependent Flux Boundary (Cauchy, Mixed, and Robin condition)
    **Definition:** The flow across the boundary is proportional to the difference between the aquifer head at the boundary and an external head of the boundary (e.g., river stage, adjacent aquifer head, drain elevation). A *conductance factor controls the flux across the boundary in response to the head gradient* between the aquifer and the boundary. In some cases, geometric aspects of the feature represented by the boundary are used to limit or prevent flow to, or from, the boundary depending on the value of head in the aquifer at the boundary.

    st.markdown("""
    **Effect:** A head-dependent flow boundary provides a resistive zone between the aquifer and the water body that the boundary represents. Depending on the head difference between the model calculated head in the aquifer at the boundary and the assigned head from the boundary condition (e.g., river stage or drain elevation), the boundary can act as sink or source. 
    
    In other words, the boundary behaves as a specified head boundary with a resistive connection as opposed to a direct connection to the water body being represented. Like a specified-head boundary, the head in the feature represented by the boundary condition does not change no matter how much water flows into or out of the groundwater system. The difference is the additional resistive layer and the limit to flow based on the geometry of the feature represented by the boundary.
    
    **Example application in the subsequent interactive plots:**
    - :green[**Scenario 1**]: The specified head boundary on the right becomes head-dependent when the River BC toggle is activated (under the assumption that the river is exchanging water with the aquifer at the boundary under fully saturated conditions, allowing water to freely discharge to, or be recharged from, the river system).

            **Getting Started with the Interactive Plot** Instructions for :green[**Scenario 1**]: Exploring Model Behavior and _Q_-_h_ Relationships
            
            Use the interactive tools in :green[**Scenario 1**] to investigate how model parameters and boundary conditions affect hydraulic head distributions and boundary flows. Follow the steps below to explore key relationships and system behavior.
            
            **1. Modify Model Parameters**
            - Open the Control Panel and click "Modify Model Parameters".
            - Begin by increasing (or decreasing) the Recharge rate.
            - Observe how the hydraulic head distribution changes throughout the domain.
            - Next, adjust the Hydraulic Conductivity:
               - üîΩ Lower values result in steeper gradients due to the reduced transmissivity (for positive recharge heads rise and for negative recharge heads decline).
               - üîº Higher values result in lower gradients due to increased transmissivity (for positive recharge heads decline and for negative recharge heads rise).
            - Proceed with a higher hydraulic conductivity and note the changes in head profiles.
            
            **2. Activate and Explore the _Q_-_h_ Plot**
            - Navigate to the Input Menu and click "Click for the _Q_-_h_ plot".
            - Select one of the available _Q_-_h_ plots to display. Start with the No-Flow Boundary.
            - The red dot in the _Q_-_h_ plot represents the _Q_-_h_ state at a specific point in the model (upper figure).
            - This point corresponds to the selected boundary condition and dynamically updates.
            
            **3. Analyze Parameter Sensitivity**
            - Vary the recharge and observe how the red dot shifts vertically:
                - For the No-Flow Boundary, the flow remains constant at zero, while the head adjusts with changing parameters.
                - Change hydraulic conductivity and again observe the effect on head and the red dot location.
            
            **4. Explore Head-dependent (River) Boundaries**
            - Return to the Input Menu, activate the River boundary, and then activate the _Q_-_h_ plot for the River Boundary.
            - While the River Boundary is active:
              - Adjust Recharge and note how both hydraulic head and flow change.
              - Modify the River Conductance (_the units of the conductance are m¬≤/s, this is explained in the :violet[**RIV**] section of the module._): Observe the head changes in the model and the different appearance of the ***Q-h*** plot. This demonstrates some characteristics of head-dependent boundaries. The next step considers the application of these boundary conditions.
              
            **5. Understand the Role of Head-Dependent Boundaries in Applied Groundwater Modelling** 
            
            Head-dependent boundaries (such as River, General Head, or Drain boundaries) are commonly used to simulate interactions between an aquifer and external systems, where the flow across the boundary is not fixed, but governed by a conductance term and the difference in head between the groundwater at the boundary and the boundary elevation or head of the external system (_this is explained more in the sections :orange[**GHB**], :violet[**RIV**], :green[**DRN**] of this module_).
            
            The use of these boundaries can be considered in two fundamentally different ways depending on the modeling context, first:
            
            **a) During Model Calibration or Model Setup:** One might have field data indicating the groundwater discharge to the river (for example 1.6x10‚Åª‚Åµ m¬≥/s per meter length of river). Given that the river is the only outlet of the model, the recharge rate can be calculated by dividing the discharge by the surface area of the model (2500 m by 1 m). Then, the hydraulic conductivity and conductance can be adjusted until the model heads match the measured field heads.
            
            To explore this behavior:
            - Set the recharge to a value of (approximately) 200 mm/a.
            - Use the toggle to show the ***Q-h*** plot of the specified head boundary (on the right side). The blue dot represents the outflow at the boundary.
            - Modify the hydraulic conductivity and the recharge to see how the Q-h plot reacts (focus on the blue dot that represents the head and flow at the boundary).
            - Reset the recharge to a value of (approximately) 200 mm/a.
            - Now toggle in the middle section of the :green[INPUT CONTROLS] for the :violet[River BC]. Make sure that the ***Q-h*** plot for the River boundary is active. The magenta-dot represents the outflow and head at the boundary.
            - Assess the difference between the Specified head and the River boundary by setting and resetting the :violet[River BC] toggle and study the ***Q-h*** plot with the aquifer hydraulic conductivity higher than the river conductance. The flow, which is solely a function of the recharge, is identical but the head at the boundary is increased if the :violet[River BC] is active AND the conductance value is less than the aquifer hydraulic conductivity (the same would be the case for other head-dependent boundary conditions like :orange[**GHB**] or :green[**DRN**]. If the conductance is higher than the aquifer hydraulic conductivity, then including the river bed does not change the heads in the system. If the conductance is much lower than the aquifer hydraulic conductivity then there is a steep gradient near the river.
            - It is useful to experiment with values of conductance $C_{Riv}$ and observe how the heads in the model and the ***Q‚Äìh*** relationship change.
            
            A second way to use the river boundary: 
            
            **b) Once the Model is Calibrated such that the values of Recharge and Conductance are no longer adjusted:** If other outlets are added to the system (e.g., abstraction wells, drains) the heads in the model will be a result of all the model boundary conditions and parameter values. In consequence, the previously calibrated, and then specified, conductance will control how much of the recharge flows to the river boundary. The discharge will also depend on the location and properties of the other outlets. Such cases are discussed in the :orange[**GHB**], :violet[**RIV**], and :green[**DRN**] sections of this module. Further instructions for exploring the influence of boundary conditions are provided in those sections.

            **Getting Started with the Interactive Plot** Instructions for :red[**Scenario 2**]: Recharge, Groundwater Divide, and Boundary Flow Response
            
            :red[**Scenario 2**] allows you to explore the development of a groundwater divide under recharge conditions, and to investigate how hydraulic conductivity, boundary elevations, and model parameters influence both flow dynamics and _Q_-_h_ relationships.
            
            **1. Modify Model Parameters**
            - Click "Modify Model Parameters" in the Control Panel to begin.
            - Increase the Recharge:
              - A red vertical line will appear in the plot, marking the location of the groundwater divide.
              - Adjust the Hydraulic Conductivity:
                - üîΩ Lower values create steeper gradients and form a distinct ‚Äúgroundwater mound‚Äù.
                - Use a very low hydraulic conductivity to clearly visualize this effect.
            
            **2. Investigate Flow and Divide Behavior**
            - The plot dynamically shows outflow values across the boundaries.
            - Click the middle tab in the Input Controls to access Boundary Condition Parameters.
            - Modify the elevation of the left specified head boundary:
              - üîº Increasing the left head: Shifts the groundwater divide to the left. This also increases the hydraulic gradient and flow at the right boundary. The flow at the boundary increases because the area (right from the divide) that collects recharge is larger. 
              - üîΩ Decreasing the left head: Moves the divide to the right. Accordingly, reduces the contributing recharge area to the right boundary and lowers outflow.
              - Using a high üîº head on the left coupled with a low üîΩ recharge rate and a high üîº hydraulic conductivity results in flow through the aquifer from left to right at a rate higher than the inflowing recharge and there is there is no flow divide within the model.
            
            **3. Explore the _Q_-_h_ Plot Dynamics**
            - Activate the _Q_-_h_ Plot for the Right Specified Head Boundary:
              - A blue dot in the main plot highlights the boundary condition point.
              - The _Q_-_h_ plot shows this as a blue dot at a fixed head of 150 m.
            - As you adjust the left specified head, observe how the blue dot moves:
              - üîº When the left head increases, the groundwater divide moves to the left and more recharge flows to the right boundary ‚Üí the blue dot moves down, indicating higher outflow.
              - üîΩ When the left head decreases, the contributing area shrinks ‚Üí the blue dot moves up, indicating reduced flow.
            
            **4. Run Comparative Experiments**
            - Switch between the different _Q_-_h_ plots to track how other boundaries behave.
            - Vary the following parameters to better understand interactions:
              - Recharge
              - Hydraulic Conductivity
              - Left Boundary Head

Boundary conditions are the foundation of any groundwater model. They define how water enters, exits, or interacts with the simulated model domain. Each boundary type, whether specified head, specified flow, or head-dependent flow, represents a different physical assumption and has specific implications for model behavior.

This general module introduces the concept of **_Q_-_h_ plots** as a powerful visual and conceptual tool. These plots help clarify the distinct relationships of flow and head for different boundary types and support better understanding of the sensitivity of model response to changes in boundary property values.

By exploring these relationships interactively, a user can develop a more intuitive grasp of how boundary conditions function, how they differ, and why appropriate conceptualization is essential in MODFLOW modeling.

In the following boundary-specific sections of the module, we dive deeper into each condition, with visualizations, theory, and targeted assessments. But prior moving on, it may be helpful to take the final assessment to self-check your understanding.
