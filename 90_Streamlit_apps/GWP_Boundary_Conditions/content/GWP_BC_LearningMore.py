Many variations of these boundary conditions are available in groundwater flow codes. When encountering a new type of boundary condition, it is useful to think of how it performs in terms of a $Q$-$h$ plot. Variations of the boundary conditions discussed in this module are mentioned in this section to provide ideas for further study. 

For example, MODFLOW includes boundary options that are similar to the RIV boundary but allow the exchange of water to change both the boundary head and the volume of water stored in the boundary feature; and some allow for outflow from the boundary to be returned to the groundwater system in other locations within the model. These river-related conditions include the following packages and processes:
- STR, stream;
- SFR, stream-flow routing;
- DAFLOW, delayed flow; 
- LAK, lake; and
- RES, reservoir.

Also, there is an enhanced version of the DRN drain boundary conditions is the DRT - drain return flow package that allows water discharged to drains to be reintroduced to the model in other locations. 

More elaborate representation of evapotranspiration is possible by using the ETS, evapotranspiration segments package that allows the ET slope to vary with depth of the groundwater head; or the RIP riparian evapotranspiration package that allows definition of the spatial distribution of plant type and associated evapotranspiration behavior including a decrease in the rate when heads rise in cases where a high water table is detrimental to plants.

More information about MODFLOW boundary conditions can be accessed via https://ca.water.usgs.gov/modeling-software/one-water-hydrologic-model/users-manual/index.html?head_dependent_flux_boundary_p.htm.

Additional, excellent discussion of boundary conditions is provided by T.E. Reilly (2001) "System and Boundary Conceptualization in Ground-Water Flow Simulation", Techniques of Water-Resources Investigations of the U.S. Geological Survey Book 3, Applications of Hydraulics, Chapter B8. https://pubs.usgs.gov/twri/twri-3_B8/pdf/twri_3b8.pdf.
