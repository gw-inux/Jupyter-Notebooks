    ### Description
    The Boundary Condition Analysis interactive tool provides a conceptual understanding of how different boundary types influence groundwater flow. The application uses **Q‚Äìh plots**, graphical representations of the relationship between discharge (_Q_) and hydraulic head (_h_), to illustrate the behavior of defined head, no-flow, and head-dependent boundaries such as rivers and general head boundaries. A one-dimensional unconfined aquifer serves as an example to demonstrate how these boundary conditions control flow directions and magnitudes.

    
    ### Development
    Innovative and digital learning and teaching materials are currently enhanced and transferred to various partners across Europe by the EU cooperation project [iNUX](https://www.gw-inux.org/). The iNUX project is funded by the ERASMUS+ program of the European Union.
    
    The Boundary Condition Module was developed by Thomas Reimann, Eileen Poeter, and the iNUX Team as a Streamlit application and adapted to the Groundwater Project interactive education format. It was released in June of 2025. All Groundwater Project books are available for free download.

        Thomas Reimann is a researcher and lecturer at the Institute for Groundwater Management at TU Dresden, Germany. With nearly 20 years of experience, Thomas‚Äô work focus on groundwater engineering, often in combination with distributed numerical models in different environments, e.g., karst systems or open-pit mining for soft coal. He received a diploma in water management with a focus on groundwater engineering from TU Dresden in 2003. In 2012 he was promoted to Dr.-Ing. (Ph.D.) in groundwater management for research in karst systems by TU Dresden.
        
        Thomas is a specialist in applying and adapting distributed numerical models for use in research and industry. He enhanced the distributed numerical discrete-continuum model MODFLOW Conduit Flow Process (CFP) by various boundary conditions, flow- and transport processes as CFPv2. Current research projects comprise Karst system characterization with inverse groundwater modeling, groundwater management in open-pit mining environments, and Managed Aquifer Recharge.
        
        Besides research, he has been actively teaching groundwater management and groundwater modeling since 2003 at TU Dresden and as a guest lecturer for Hydrogeology since 2017 at the University of Gothenburg (Sweden). The ongoing teaching activities use various innovative digital methods to improve the learning process, which was honored by the TU Dresden teaching award in 2017.
