    """
    The Boundary Condition Module includes interactive tools to facilitate conceptual understanding of how different boundary types influence groundwater flow. The application uses **Q‚Äìh plots**, graphical representations of the relationship between discharge (_Q_) and hydraulic head (_h_), to illustrate the behavior of defined head, no-flow, and head-dependent flux boundaries such as surface water bodies and drains. A one-dimensional unconfined aquifer serves as an example to demonstrate how the boundary conditions control flow directions and magnitudes.

        :blue[**Thomas Reimann**] is a researcher and lecturer at the Institute for Groundwater Management at TU Dresden, Germany. With nearly 20 years of experience, Thomas‚Äô work focuses on groundwater engineering, often in combination with distributed numerical models in different environments, e.g., karst systems or open-pit mining for soft coal. He received a diploma in water management with a focus on groundwater engineering from TU Dresden in 2003. In 2012 he was promoted to Dr.-Ing. (Ph.D.) in groundwater management for research in karst systems by TU Dresden.
        
        Thomas is a specialist in applying and adapting distributed numerical models for use in research and industry. He enhanced the distributed numerical discrete-continuum model MODFLOW Conduit Flow Process (CFP) with various boundary conditions, as well as flow and transport processes in CFPv2. Current research projects comprise Karst system characterization with inverse groundwater modeling, groundwater management in open-pit mining environments, and Managed Aquifer Recharge.
        
        Besides research, he has been actively teaching groundwater management and groundwater modeling since 2003 at TU Dresden and as a guest lecturer for Hydrogeology since 2017 at the University of Gothenburg (Sweden). His ongoing teaching activities use various innovative digital methods to improve the learning process, which was honored by the TU Dresden teaching award in 2017.

        In January 1983, she began a career with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and gained experience in surface-water modeling, project management, borehole geophysics, geologic mapping, field data collection, groundwater flow and transport simulation, Geographic Information Systems, karst hydrology, and aquifer hydraulics. In 1998, she was promoted to Southeastern Region Groundwater Specialist providing technical assistance to groundwater projects throughout the southeastern USA, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. As the regional groundwater specialist, she was required to review and approve all aquifer pumping tests and groundwater flow modeling reports and archives prior to publication. Because of her expertise she was frequently selected for short term international assignments by the USGS International Water Resources Branch, serving in China, Israel, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa.
