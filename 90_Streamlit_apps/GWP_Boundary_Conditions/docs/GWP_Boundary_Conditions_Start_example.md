This is an example of an expandable section. We use expandable sections to provide self-assessments, additional explanations, instructions, and exercises. 

Some of the expandable sections can be opened in a separate tab for user-convenience. For example, once a set of step-by-step instructions is opened in a new tab, the tab can be dragged out of the current browser window so that two browser windows can be viewed side-by-side. This makes it easier to follow the instructions because you do not have to scroll up and down between the instructions and the interactive graph.

Once you have worked through an expandable section, you can close it by clicking on the caret (^) key.
