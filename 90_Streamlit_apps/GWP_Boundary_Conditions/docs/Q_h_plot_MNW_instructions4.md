Follow these steps to explore threshold-controlled withdrawal behavior in MNW:

**1. Start by setting the following values**
   * Limiting head $h_{lim} = 2.0$ m
   * $h_{gw} = 10$ m
   * CWC parameters: $A = 5.0$, $B = 5.0$, $C = 0$, $P = 2.0$

**2. Step through values of $h_{gw}$**
   * Vary groundwater head $h_{gw}$ from 10.0 to 19.0 m and observe how discharge $Q$ responds to groundwater head changes
   
**3. Modify Parameters**
   * Adjust values of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $P$ and observe how the shape of the ***Q-h*** plot responds.
   * Vary groundwater head $h_{gw}$ and the ratio of well-head/limiting-head $h_{well}$/$h_{lim}$, and investigate the MNW behavior for this ***Q-h*** plot with the interactive diagram.
   * Identify the well head $h_{well}$ and the groundwater head $h_{gw}$ where the discharge becomes zero

ðŸ’¡ Following these steps facilitates understanding of how the MNW package incorporates head targets and can be used to estimate well discharge.
