🎯 **Learning Objectives**

This exercise is designed with the intent that, upon completion, you will be able to:

- Explain how the limiting head influence MNW discharge behavior
- Analyze how nonlinear head losses and operational limits combine to define feasible withdrawal rates

🛠️ **Exercise Instructions**

1. **Identify the outflow from an artesian flowing well**
   * Set: $A = 5$, $B = 5$, $C = 0.0$ $P = 1.0$, $h_{gw} = 15$ m, $h_{lim} = 5$ m
   * 📝 Identify the Q that flows out of the well
   * 📝 Quantify how Q changes when the groundwater head declines from 15 m to 12 m.

2. **Test Effect of Nonlinearity**
   * Set $h_{gw} = 18$ m and observe $Q$
   * then increase $P$ to 3.5 and observe $Q$
   * Reset $P$ = 1.0, set $C$ = 3.0 and observe $Q$
   * then increase $P$ to 3.5 again and observe $Q$

3. **Effect of linear losses**
   * Reset to: $A = 5$, $B = 5$, $C = 0.0$ $P = 1.0$, $h_{gw} = 15$ m, $h_{lim} = 5$ m
   * Double $B$ (keep the others fixed)
   * Quantify how the discharge changes for Δh = 4.3 m.

💭 Reflect:
- How does the MNW boundary behave in this exercise? What other boundary condition presented in this module exhibits comparable behavior?
- How do linear and nonlinear losses shape the Q-h curve? What does this mean for the resulting outflow?

This exploration prepares you to interpret MNW behavior in model calibration and design tasks.
