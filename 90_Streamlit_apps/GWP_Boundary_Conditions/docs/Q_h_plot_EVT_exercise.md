üéØ **Expected Learning Outcomes**

Completion of this exercise helps you to:

- Understand the threshold-controlled behavior of the ET boundary condition
- Evaluate how extinction depth and surface elevation influence the rate of evapotranspiration
- Relate evapotranspiration losses to groundwater sustainability

üõ†Ô∏è **Instructions**

Use the interactive ET plot to complete the following steps:

1. **Initial Setup**
    * Start with **_SURF_** = 9 m, **_EXDP_** = 4 m, and **_EVTR_** = 730 mm/yr 
    * View conditions by stepping through a range of groundwater heads from 3 m to 10 m

    **Observe and record:**

        * The head at which ET reaches its maximum value
       * The head at which ET drops to zero
       * The shape of the Q‚Äìh curve between these thresholds

2. **Test Sensitivity to Extinction Depth**

    * Set **_SURF_** at 9 m and **$h_{gw}$** to 6 m
    * View conditions by stepping through **_EXDP_** from 1 to 5 m
    * For each value of **_EXDP_**, observe the slope of the ET curve and the value of **$Q_{ET}$** for the groundwater head of 6 m

3. **Explore ET Surface Elevation Effects**

    * Set _**EXDP**_ = 3 m  and **$h_{gw}$** to 6 m
    * View results for _**SURF**_ = 7 m, 8 m, 9 m, and 10 m
    * For each value of _**SURF**_, observe the slope of the ET curve and the value of **$Q_{ET}$** for the groundwater head of 6 m
    * Observe how this shifts the entire ET response curve along the vertical axis

üí° **Reflection:**
- When is groundwater significantly contributing to ET?
- What happens to ET when groundwater levels are low during droughts or due to pumping?
- How can extinction depth help represent different vegetation types or soil conditions?
