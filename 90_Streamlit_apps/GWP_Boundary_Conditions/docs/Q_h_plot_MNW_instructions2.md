#### :green[ðŸ§­ Getting Started]

Begin with the following steps to explore the MNW dischargeâ€“head relationship:
 
 **1. To start exploring, enter a value of 3 for $A$, $B$, $C$, and $P$ to represent a well with significant losses** 
    * The groundwater head is fixed at $h_{gw}$ = $10$ m in this plot
 
 **2. Explore Q-target Mode**
    * Toggle to **modify CWC parameters**
    * Set the CWC parameter values to: $A$ = $5.0$, $B$ = $5.0$, $C$ = $1.0$, $P$ = $2.0$
    * Adjust discharge $Q$ in steps between $0.05$ and $0.7$ mÂ³/s and observe the resulting well head $h_{well}$ and increasing drawdown
 
 **3. Switch to H-target Mode**
    * Set the CWC parameter values to: $A$ = $5.0$, $B$ = $5.0$, $C$ = $1.0$, $P$ = $2.0$
    * Adjust drawdown $Î”h$ in steps between $1.0$ and $6.5$ m and observe how discharge changes with increasing drawdown
 
 **4. Modify CWC Parameter Values**
    * For both Q-target Mode and H-target Mode:
      * Try different values for $A$, $B$, and $P$
      * Compare how the drawdown or flow response changes
 
ðŸ’¡ Consider how your observations differ from the behavior of **DRN** and **RIV** boundaries (linear, head-dependent flow) and from **WEL** and **RCH** boundaries (fixed Q).
