**Getting Started with the Interactive Plot**
 
Before starting the exercise, it is helpful to follow these steps to explore DRN behavior:
 
1. **Start with $H_{D}$ = 8 m, $h_{gw}$ = 10 m, and $C_{B}$ = 1x10⁻² m²/s** 
 
 * Vary **groundwater head** $h_{gw}$ in steps between 6 and 12 m (if you prefer there is a toggle button under **Modify Plot Controls** that allows you to type in values instead of using the slider).
 * Observe how the flow $Q_D$ changes:
     * When $h_{gw} > H_D$, the groundwater drains, that is flow leaves the groundwater through the drain.
     * When $h_{gw} \leq H_D$, no flow occurs because the drain is inactive.
     
2. **Experiment with Different Conductance Values**
 
 * With $h_{gw} > H_D$, use the slider to vary $C_D$ and notice how the **slope of the Q–h curve** changes — higher conductance leads to stronger response of outflow to head differences.
 
 These steps help you build intuition for how DRN parameters govern flow — especially the **threshold behavior** and **linear relationship** between head difference and outflow. Feel free to further investigate the interactive plot on your own.
