🎯 **Expected Learning Outcomes**

Completion of this exercise helps you to accomplish the following.

* Understand how GHB flux is driven by head difference and conductance.
* Interpret Q–h plots in relation to hydrogeologic behavior.
* Develop the ability to use this application for conceptual testing and scenario analysis.

🛠️ **Instructions**

Use the interactive GHB plot as follows:

**1. Start with $H_{B}$ = 8 m, $h_{gw}$ = 10 m, and $C_{B}$ = 1x10⁻² m²/s**

* Vary the groundwater head ($h_{gw}$) from **5 m to 15 m**
* Observe and describe how the flux ($Q$) changes
* Record:
  * The sign of the flux for different $h_{gw}$ values
  * The value of $Q$ when $h_{gw}$ = $H_B$

**2. Conductance Effect**
        
* Start with $H_{B}$ = 8 m, $h_{gw}$ = 10 m, and $C_{B}$ = 1x10⁻² m²/s
* Choose three different conductance values (e.g., **3x10⁻², 3x10⁻³, and 3x10⁻⁴ m²/s**)
  * Cycle through the 3 conductance values a couple of times, noting the influence of conductance on the slope of the line and flow conditions
* Choose one conductance value (e.g., **3x10⁻³ m²/s**) and three values of $H_B$ with increased and decreased values (e.g., **5, 9, and 20 m**)
  * Cycle through the 3 $H_B$ values a couple of times, noting the influence of conductance on the slope of the line and flow conditions

**3. Realistic Scenarios**

* Imagine a GHB represents a canal system connected to the groundwater system. The canal water level is 10 m.
* Assume the groundwater head starts at 8 m.
* Evaluate how much water would enter the groundwater system for:
  * A poorly connected canal (low conductance)
  * A well-connected canal (high conductance)
* Consider the implications of your findings for water management
