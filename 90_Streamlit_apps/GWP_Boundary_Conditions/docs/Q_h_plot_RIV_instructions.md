**Getting Started with the Interactive Plot**

Before starting the exercise, it is helpful to follow these steps to explore RIV behavior:

**Start with $H_{RIV}$ = 9 m, $R_{bot}$ = 7 m, $h_{gw}$ = 10 m, and $C_{RIV}$ = 1x10⁻² m²/s**
* Vary groundwater head $h_{gw}$ and observe how the flow $Q_{RIV}$ changes in magnitude and direction.
    * When $h_{gw} > H_{RIV}$, the groundwater discharges to the river (losing river).
    * When $h_{gw} < H_{RIV}$ but $h_{gw} > R_{bot}$, the river recharges the groundwater (gaining river).
    * When $h_{gw} < R_{bot}$, the river is not in direct contact with the groundwater. Flow through an unsaturated zone occurs, which is driven by the head gradient between river stage and river bottom. In this case, outflow from the river is constant and independent of $h_{gw}$.
* Use the slider to vary $C_{RIV}$ and notice how the slope of the $Q$–$h$ curve changes, with higher conductance resulting in more exchange of flow.
* Toggle “Compute conductance” then enter $K$, $A_{riv}$, and $L_{RIV}$ to calculate $C_{RIV} = \frac{KA_{RIV}}{L_{RIV}}$ and notice how the conductance value influences the _Q_–_h_ relationship.
* Set $h_{gw}$ < $R_{bot}$ and compute $C_{RIV}$ directly. Investigate the effect of the river bottom elevation $R_{bot}$ and river bed thickness $M_{RIV}$ on flow at the RIV boundary.

The subsequent exercise is designed to help you build intuition for how RIV parameters control flow.  Feel free to further investigate the interactive plot on your own.
