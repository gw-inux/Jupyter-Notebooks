 
üéØ **Expected Learning Outcomes**
 
Completion of this exercise helps you to:
 
* Understand how river‚Äìgroundwater exchange is controlled by stage, groundwater head, bottom elevation, and conductance.
* Interpret _Q_‚Äì_h_ plots in relation to gaining, losing, or inactive river segments.
* Identify conditions that limit or enable flow across the riverbed.
* Develop the ability to test and visualize river boundary behavior through scenario analysis.
 
üõ†Ô∏è **Instructions**
Use the interactive RIV plot and complete the following steps:

1. **Initial Exploration**
 
* Set the **river head** ($H_{RIV}$) to **10 m** (remember that under INPUT CONTROLS, in the **"Modify Plot Controls"** drop-down menu, you can toggle to choose between slider or typed input to adjust the parameter values)
* Set the **river bottom elevation** ($R_{bot}$) to **9 m**
* Vary the **groundwater head** ($h_{gw}$) from **8 m to 12 m** while observing and describing how the flow ($Q_{riv}$) changes. It is useful to expand the area below the graph that is labeled "Click here to show Parameters and Results". It is helpful to keep notes on the values you observe, so you may want to record the following items.
 
üìù Record:
 
* Whether the river is gaining or losing in each case.
* The conditions where no flow occurs.
* The transition points between gaining/losing/inactive behavior.

2. **Effect of Conductance**
* Set $H_{RIV}$ = 10 m and $R_{bot}$ = 9 m
* Choose three different conductance values (e.g., **1x10‚Åª¬≤, 1x10‚Åª¬≥, and 1x10‚Åª‚Å¥ m¬≤/s**)
   * For each of the 3 conductance values view the plot $Q_{RIV}$ vs $h_{gw}$ while adjusting $h_{gw}$ from 8 m to 12 m and note the influence of conductance on the slope of the line and the magnitude of flow. It is helpful to keep notes on the values you observe, so you may want to record the following items.
           
üìù Record:

* Whether the river is gaining or losing in each case.
* Whether no flow occurs and, if so, for what conditions.
* Take note of transition points between gaining/losing/inactive behavior.
 
3. **Realistic Scenarios: Recession Flow**
 
* Imagine a river with stage $H_{RIV}$ **decreasing** from **11 m** to **9 m** (e.g., during a dry spell)
* Set river bottom to **8.5 m**
* Groundwater head is fixed at **9.2 m**
 
üí≠ Explore:
 
* How does the direction and magnitude of flow change as the river stage drops?
* How does the bottom elevation restrict or allow recharge?
* Discuss which condition (stage or bottom) dominates the system behavior
