**Getting Started with the Interactive Plot**
 
Before starting the exercise, it is helpful to follow these steps to understand how evapotranspiration (ET) interacts with the water table:
 
**Start with _SURF_ = 9 m, _EXDP_ = 4 m, $h_{gw}$ = 8 m, and _EVTR_ = 2000 mm/yr** 
 
* Adjust the groundwater head in steps from $h_{gw}$ ranging from 0.0 m to 10.0 m (if you prefer there is a toggle button under **Modify Plot Controls** that allows you to type in values instead of using the slider) and notice how $Q_{ET}$ changes:
  - ET is zero below _**SURF**_ - _**EXDP**_ (which is equal to the expiration elevation shown on the graph)
  - ET increases linearly as $h_{gw}$ rises above _**SURF**_ - _**EXDP**_
  - Maximum ET occurs when $h_{gw}$ => _**SURF**_

**Start with _SURF_ = 9 m, _EXDP_ = 1 m, $h_{gw}$ = 8 m, and _EVTR_ = 2000 mm/yr, then analyze the influence of _EXDP_**.
 
* Increase _**EXDP**_ in steps and observe how the slope of the _Q–h_ curve flattens and how $Q_{ET}$ changes.

These steps build a foundation for the full exercise. Feel free to interactively explore additional parameter value combinations.
