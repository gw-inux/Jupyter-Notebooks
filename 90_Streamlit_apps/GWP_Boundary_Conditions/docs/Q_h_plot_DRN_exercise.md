🎯 **Expected Learning Outcomes**
 
Completion of this exercise helps you to:
 
- Understand how drain–groundwater interaction is controlled by groundwater head, drain elevation, and conductance.
- Interpret the boundary characteristics with a Q–h plot.
- Recognize the threshold behavior of the DRN package and its role as a one-way boundary.
- Evaluate how conductance controls the rate of drainage when groundwater head is above a threshold elevation.
- Analyze realistic scenarios (e.g., excavation of a building foundation) and the implications for boundary fluxes.
 
🛠️ **Instructions**
 
Use the interactive DRN plot to complete the following steps:
 
1. **Initial Exploration (hint: there is a toggle button under **Modify Plot Controls** that allows you to type in values instead of using the slider)**
 
* Start with $H_{D}$ = 8 m, $h_{gw}$ = 10 m, and $C_{B}$ = 1x10⁻² m²/s
* Vary the groundwater head ($h_{gw}$) from 8 m to 12 m and observe how the flow ($Q_D$) responds to changes in head
 
Make a record of:
 
    * The threshold value at which the drain becomes active
    * The linearity of the Q–h relationship once the threshold is exceeded
    * Drain flow when groundwater head is less than the drain elevation

2. **Effect of Conductance**
 * Start with $H_{D}$ = 8 m, $h_{gw}$ = 10 m, and $C_{B}$ = 1x10⁻² m²/s
 * Choose three different conductance values (e.g., 1x10⁻², 1x10⁻³, and 1x10⁻⁴ m²/s)
   * For each of the 3 conductance values view the plot $Q_{D}$ vs $h_{gw}$ while adjusting $h_{gw}$ from 6 m to 12 m and note the influence of conductance on the slope of the line and the magnitude of flow.
3. **Realistic Scenario: Excavating a building foundation**
 - Fix the groundwater head at 10.3 m
 - In 1-m steps, vary drain elevation from 9.3 m to 6.3 m, and make note of the flow rate to the drain
 - Consider this as a simplified representation of increasing inflow that needs to be collected and routed away from a construction site. A similar process might be used at a larger scale for an open-pit mine.
💡 **Explore:**
 - How does flow to the drain change as the excavation deepens?
 - What would the construction company have to do to address the inflow?
 - What would reduce the inflow?
 - How might conductance be decreased on excavation walls?
 - How might surrounding groundwater heads be lowered?
