    "question": "Which conditions lead to increased drawdown for a fixed pumping rate in a Multi-Node Well (MNW)? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Higher linear resistance (larger A)": true,
      "B) Higher linear loss coefficient (larger B)": true,
      "C) Lower exponent P when C=0": false,
      "D) Reduced conductance due to well clogging": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. All answers except a lower P with C=0 result in increased drawdown for the same discharge.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Drawdown increases with higher A, B, and lower effective conductance. When C=0, P has no influence on drawdown."
  },
  {
    "question": "In Q-target mode, what does the app solve for? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The well head corresponding to the given discharge": true,
      "B) The required drawdown to achieve the selected Q": true,
      "C) A fixed head in the groundwater": false,
      "D) The discharge at a given well head": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes. In Q-target, the model computes the drawdown (and thus well head) needed to produce Q.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. In Q-target mode, the discharge is fixed — the drawdown and well head are computed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of exponent P in the nonlinear CWC formulation? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It controls how strongly drawdown increases with discharge": true,
      "B) It appears in a power term applied to Q": true,
      "C) It has no effect at low discharge values": false,
      "D) It determines the transition between linear and nonlinear flow behavior": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. P defines the nonlinearity; the higher it is, the faster drawdown increases with Q.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. All but the third option are correct. P affects behavior even at low Q, though less noticeably."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which combination of parameter changes leads to a steeper Q–Δh curve at all values of Q? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Increasing A and B with C=0": true,
      "B) Increasing P while keeping A and B constant": false,
      "C) Decreasing A and B with C=0": false,
      "D) Reducing the groundwater head": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes. Higher A and B result in larger head losses and steepen the Q–Δh response, but increasing P results in a steeper curve for only some values of Q.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Only increasing resistance terms A and B steepens the Q–Δh curve for all values of Q."
  },
  {
    "question": "When comparing two parameter sets, why might their Q–Δh curves diverge only at higher discharge values? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Because nonlinear terms become more dominant at high Q": true,
      "B) Because both parameter sets may have the same linear resistance A": true,
      "C) Because drawdown becomes less sensitive to P at high Q": false,
      "D) Because the groundwater head decreases with increasing discharge": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. At low Q, differences are minor; at high Q, nonlinear losses (C, P) dominate the increase of drawdown in the well.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Only nonlinear terms cause divergence at high Q. Groundwater head is fixed in this plot."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are correct interpretations of the second parameter set in the interactive MNW plot? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It allows users to compare alternative well designs or conditions.": true,
      "B) It is only used for calibration against observed data.": false,
      "C) It helps visualize the influence of parameter changes on drawdown.": true,
      "D) It represents a second well in the same cell.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. The second set allows for comparison to explore parameter sensitivity and impact of differences in well conditions.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. It's used for comparison — not calibration or multi-well representation."
