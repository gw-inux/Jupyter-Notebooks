    "question": "Which equation best describes actual ET in MODFLOW? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) ET = ETmax if head ≥ ET surface": true,
      "B) ET = ETmax × (head - extinction depth) / (ET surface - extinction depth)": true,
      "C) ET = 0 if head < extinction depth": true,
      "D) ET = constant at all heads": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. The ET function is piecewise linear, with full, partial, or no ET.",
    "error": "❌ Actual ET depends on groundwater depth relative to ET surface and extinction depth."

      "A) ET surface elevation": true,
      "B) Extinction depth": true,
      "C) Aquifer transmissivity": false,
      "D) Maximum ET rate (ETmax)": true

      "A) ET = 0": true,
      "B) ET = ETmax": false,
      "C) ET continues at a reduced rate": false,
      "D) ET increases due to capillarity": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. No ET occurs below the extinction depth.",
    "error": "❌ Actual ET stops once groundwater is too deep."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is the ET Q–h plot flat for high heads? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Because actual ET equals potential ET when water is near the surface": true,
      "B) Because of hydraulic resistance in the unsaturated zone": false,
      "C) Because recharge dominates at shallow depths": false,
      "D) Because aquifer head doesn’t influence ET at those depths": true
    },
    "success": "✅ That’s it. The flat region means ET is maxed out near the ET surface.",
    "error": "❌ When water is shallow, ET rate is unaffected by further head increases."

  {
    "question": "What is the conceptual role of the extinction depth in groundwater models? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It defines when evapotranspiration ceases": true,
      "B) It sets the bottom of the ET boundary condition": true,
      "C) It marks the end of unsaturated zone storage": false,
      "D) It models where roots can no longer access water": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes — extinction depth defines where ET can no longer extract water.",
    "error": "❌ The extinction depth relates to vegetation, not unsaturated storage."

      "C) Maximum ET rate": false,
      "D) Head-dependent extraction": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. This slope shows how ET is reduced as the water table drops.",
    "error": "❌ The slope reflects the transition zone — not max or nonlinear behavior."
