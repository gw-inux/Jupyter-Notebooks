    "question": "Why is a specified-head boundary represented as a vertical line in a Q–h plot? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "Because the head remains constant regardless of flow rate.": true,
      "Because the flow rate remains constant.": false,
      "Because the groundwater system has no recharge.": false,
      "Because it reflects external control, like a large river or lake.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! For a Dirichlet condition, head is specified and Q varies. It often reflects external controls like large lakes that are in direct contact with the groundwater system.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. For a Dirichlet condition, the head is specified, not the flow, and the value of recharge does not influence the value of specified head."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which characteristics best describe a head-dependent boundary (Robin condition)? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "The flow depends on the difference between groundwater head and external head.": true,
      "It involves a conductance term that controls how easily flow occurs.": true,
      "The head is always equal to the river stage.": false,
      "It results in zero flow under all conditions.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Head-dependent flux is based on the head difference times a conductance value that controls how easily flow occurs.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Only when head in the groundwater system and boundary are equal is the flow zero — not always. Also, the head is only equal to the river stage if there is no source of water to flow out of the boundary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens in a groundwater model if recharge is increased while keeping boundary types unchanged? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "The hydraulic head generally increases across the domain.": true,
      "The discharge at the defined-head or river boundary increases.": true,
      "The hydraulic conductivity of the groundwater system increases.": false,
      "The position of the defined head boundary shifts further into the domain.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Recharge increases head and thus outflow, but groundwater system properties and boundary locations stay the same.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Recharge affects system input and outflow, but it does not alter groundwater system properties or boundary positions."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which of the following cases does the Q–h plot appear as a horizontal line (i.e., when Q is represented by the y-axis)? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "Defined-head boundary.": false,
      "No-flow boundary.": true,
      "Recharge boundary with constant flux.": true,
      "Head-dependent boundary with high conductance.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Neumann (defined-flow) boundaries have fixed Q, so the Q–h plot is horizontal.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Horizontal Q–h lines occur when flow is fixed regardless of head — which is the case for no-flow and recharge boundaries."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which statements correctly describe the influence of hydraulic conductivity (K) in a 1D groundwater model? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "Higher K values lead to flatter hydraulic head gradients under steady recharge.": true,
      "K influences the shape of the Q–h plot at a boundary with specified head.": false,
      "Higher K results in greater discharge in models where boundary conditions allow through flow (i.e., inflow at one or more boundaries and outflow at one or more boundaries).": true,
      "K does not affect the discharge through the groundwater system with uniform recharge and only one outflow boundary.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! K determines how easily water flows through the groundwater system, affecting head gradients, and in cases where boundaries allow through flow of groundwater higher K increases inflow and outflow, but K does not the shape of the Q–h plot at a fixed-head boundary.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. K strongly influences head gradients and flow rates in a model with boundaries that allow through flow, but not the shape of the Q–h curve at a Dirichlet boundary which is determined by the definition of a specified head boundary, not by the groundwater system parameter values."

  {
    "question": "In a 1D model with recharge, a no-flow boundary, and a specified head boundary, which of the following are true? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "Flow is directed away from the no-flow boundary.": true,
      "Positive recharge causes the water table to slope away from the no-flow boundary.": true,
      "The Q–h plot at the no-flow boundary doesn't exist.": false,
      "Head-dependent flow occurs at the no-flow boundary.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! No-flow boundaries force one-directional flow; recharge raises head, but no flow occurs at the boundary.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Q–h at no-flow is vertical (Q = 0, and h is variable) and no head-dependent exchange of water occurs there."
