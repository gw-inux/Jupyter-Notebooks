    "question": "Which statements correctly describe how the Drain Boundary (DRN) behaves? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The drain only allows flow when the aquifer head exceeds the drain elevation.": true,
      "B) The DRN boundary condition allows for both inflow and outflow.": false,
      "C) When aquifer head is below the drain elevation, the boundary becomes inactive and does not influence the model.": true,
      "D) The DRN boundary enforces a constant discharge regardless of head conditions.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! DRN acts as a one-way valve — flow only occurs from aquifer to drain when $h_{aq} > H_{D}$ and the flow is not constant, it varies as $h_{aq}$ varies.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. The DRN boundary is inactive when $H_{D} ≤ h_{aq}$. It does not permit inflow into the aquifer. When the drain is active, the flow varies depending on the aquifer head $h_{aq}$ with the rate controlled by the conductance $C_D$, so the discharge is not constant."
  },
  {
    "question": "The aquifer head is situated above the drain elevation. What happens when you increase the drain elevation while keeping aquifer head constant? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The flow decreases as the head difference reduces.": true,
      "B) The slope of the Q–h curve increases.": false,
      "C) The boundary may become inactive if $H_D$ exceeds $h_{aq}$.": true,
      "D) The conductance of the boundary increases.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. A higher drain elevation reduces the head difference and may deactivate the boundary. The drain elevation does not influence conductance.",
    "error": "❌ Reconsider how head difference and threshold behavior define the flow rate in a DRN boundary."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the conductance $C_D$ influence the Q–h relationship? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It determines the slope of the Q–h curve when the drain is active.": true,
      "B) A higher conductance results in higher flow for a given head difference.": true,
      "C) Conductance has no effect when the boundary is inactive.": true,
      "D) Conductance controls the threshold at which the drain becomes active.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. Conductance controls flow once active — but the activation threshold is set by $H_{D}$ alone.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Conductance influences flow magnitude above the activation threshold but does not influence activation."

  {
    "question": "What are key differences between DRN and RIV boundaries? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) DRN boundaries only allow flow out of the aquifer, while a RIV boundary can represent both inflow and outflow.": true,
      "B) A RIV and DRN boundary perform identical actions but have different names depending on what they represent.": false,
      "C) Both boundary types allow inflow into the aquifer.": false,
      "D) DRN is suitable to represent a spring or trench where as RIV is not appropriate for such features.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. A DRN boundary is a one-way outflow mechanism, unlike the bidirectional behavior of RIV.",
    "error": "❌ Reconsider the structural and functional differences between DRN and RIV and try again to select all the correct options."

  {
    "question": "Which conditions will lead to zero flow across a DRN boundary? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) $h_{aq} = H_D$": true,
      "B) $h_{aq} < H_D$": true,
      "C) $h_{aq} > H_D$": false,
      "D) When conductance is zero": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes. Zero flow occurs when head difference is non-positive or when conductance is zero.",
    "error": "❌ Reconsider your answer so as to distinguish between threshold behavior (head) and proportionality (conductance)."

  {
    "question": "In a scenario with $h_{aq}$ = 10.5 m, what is the impact of increasing $H_D$ from 9.0 to 10.6 m? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The flow decreases steadily as $H_D$ approaches $h_{aq}$.": true,
      "B) Flow becomes zero once $H_D >= h_{aq}$.": true,
      "C) The slope of the Q–h curve increases.": false,
      "D) The conductance increases automatically.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Good analysis. The flow decreases as the head difference decreases and the drain deactivates once drain elevation exceeds aquifer head. Changing the elevation does not influence the conductance.",
    "error": "❌ Reconsider your answer to consider how raising the drain elevation affects the activation threshold and flow rate, and to decide if the elevation influences conductance."
