    "question": "What is simulated by the ET boundary condition in MODFLOW? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Loss of water from the water table due to plant uptake and evaporation": true,
      "B) River infiltration": false,
      "C) Recharge from rainfall": false,
      "D) Head-dependent discharge from shallow groundwater": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. EVT simulates shallow groundwater losses via evapotranspiration, not recharge or river seepage.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. ET represents water losses from shallow groundwater, not recharge or river seepage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under what condition is the actual ET rate equal to the maximum ET rate? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) When the water table is at or above the ET surface": true,
      "B) When the water table is below the extinction depth": false,
      "C) When the aquifer is fully saturated": false,
      "D) When the drawdown is zero": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes! At shallow depths, actual ET occurs at the maximum rate.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Evapotranspiration only occurs when the water table is at or above the defined ET surface."

  {
    "question": "How does the rate of ET change in the EVT boundary conditions as groundwater becomes deeper? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It decreases linearly until the extinction depth is reached": true,
      "B) It increases exponentially": false,
      "C) It stays constant": false,
      "D) It stops when water table falls below the extinction depth": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Good job. Actual ET decreases with depth and ceases at the extinction depth.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. The ET rate drops linearly with depth until it reaches zero."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the extinction depth represent? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Maximum root depth where plants can access groundwater": true,
      "B) Depth of bedrock": false,
      "C) Minimum saturated thickness": false,
      "D) Depth at which recharge occurs": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. The extinction depth defines the lower limit for ET activity which is typically the bottom of the root zone.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Extinction depth is a plant-access limit, not a structural or hydrologic  boundary."
