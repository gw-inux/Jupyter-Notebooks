    "question": "What does the Drain (DRN) boundary condition simulate in a groundwater model?",
    "options": {
      "A seepage face or outflow point that drains excess water.": true,
      "A river that can gain and lose water.": false,
      "A boundary that only discharges water from the aquifer.": true,
      "A constant head boundary.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. DRN boundaries simulate outflow points that discharge only when the aquifer head is above the drain elevation.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. A DRN boundary discharges groundwater and has a flow cutoff at the drain elevation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Under which condition does a DRN boundary stop discharging water?",
    "options": {
      "When the aquifer head drops below the drain elevation.": true,
      "When the aquifer head equals the drain elevation.": true,
      "When the conductance is zero.": true,
      "When the aquifer is fully saturated.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes. The flow stops when aquifer head is below or equal to the drain elevation, or if conductance is zero.",
    "error": "❌ Rethink. Flow is zero when aquifer head is at or below the drain elevation, or conductance is zero."
  },
  {
    "question": "What distinguishes the DRN boundary from the General Head Boundary (GHB)?",
    "options": {
      "DRN allows only one-directional flow.": true,
      "DRN includes a physical cutoff based on elevation.": true,
      "GHB can gain or lose water, but DRN only removes it.": true,
      "Both boundaries behave identically in all cases.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. DRN boundaries are one-directional with a cutoff. GHBs are fully head-dependent and bidirectional.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. DRNs differ from GHBs in directionality and behavior below cutoff elevation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is required to define a DRN boundary?",
    "options": {
      "Drain elevation": true,
      "Aquifer head": true,
      "Conductance": true,
      "Recharge rate": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. DRNs require elevation, aquifer head, and conductance — not recharge.",
    "error": "❌ Review needed. Recharge is not a direct input to DRN boundaries."
