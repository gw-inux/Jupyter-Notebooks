    "question": "What is a primary function of boundary conditions in groundwater models? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "They define how water enters or exits the model domain.": true,
      "They represent external controls such as rivers or impermeable barriers.": true,
      "They determine the time step of the numerical solver.": false,
      "They can include fixed recharge across the model top.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Boundary conditions include inflow, outflow, and recharge. Time step is unrelated.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Boundary conditions define entry and exit of water, they represent external controls, and can include recharge, but they do not control time steps."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following are examples of specified head boundary conditions? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A boundary with fixed hydraulic head": true,
      "A boundary with no flow allowed": false,
      "A boundary where flow depends on head difference and conductance": false,
      "A lake with a constant water level adjacent to the model": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! specified head boundary conditions fix the head at the boundary and can represent surface water bodies.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Only fixed head boundaries are specified head type boundaries and they can represent water level in water bodies connected to the model."

  {
    "question": "In a one-dimensional model with uniform recharge, a no-flow boundary on the left, and a specified head boundary on the right, which statements are true? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "Water is forced to flow towards the right boundary.": true,
      "Groundwater can exit through the no-flow boundary.": false,
      "The no-flow boundary can represent a symmetry line or impermeable wall.": true,
      "Recharge enters only at one location.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Water can only move to the right because it cannot flow out at a no-flow boundary. The no-flow boundary can represent a low permeability material or a hydraulic divide. Recharge is distributed over the model surface.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. A no-flow boundary blocks outflow so water must move to the right. The no-flow boundary can represent a low permeability material or a hydraulic divide. Uniform recharge is distributed over the surface, not localized at a point."
  },
  {
    "question": "What information does a Q–h plot provide? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "The relationship between flow (Q) and hydraulic head (h) at a boundary.": true,
      "Whether a boundary behaves like a sink or source under changing conditions.": true,
      "The hydraulic gradient within the entire groundwater system.": false,
      "The position of the water table over time.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Q–h plots illustrate boundary-specific relationships and indicate whether water enters or exits the system.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Q–h plots describe flow-head behavior at specific boundaries, not gradients over the entire system nor water level in the model."
