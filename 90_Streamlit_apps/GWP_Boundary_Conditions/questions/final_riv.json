    "question": "Which variables are required to compute the flow between the river and aquifer in the RIV boundary condition?",
    "options": {
      "Aquifer head": true,
      "River stage": true,
      "Riverbed conductance": true,
      "Aquifer transmissivity": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. The flow is calculated using aquifer head, river stage, and conductance — not transmissivity.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. The RIV equation uses river stage, aquifer head, and riverbed conductance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the effect of increasing the riverbed conductance in a RIV boundary condition?",
    "options": {
      "It increases the sensitivity of flow to the head difference.": true,
      "It reduces the maximum exchange flow possible.": false,
      "It simulates a more permeable river–aquifer connection.": true,
      "It makes the river behave like a fixed head boundary.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Higher conductance implies more exchange per unit head difference.",
    "error": "❌ The correct choices indicate increased sensitivity and permeability — not fixed-head behavior."
  },
  {
    "question": "When does flow between the aquifer and river stop in the RIV boundary?",
    "options": {
      "When the aquifer head drops below the riverbed bottom elevation": true,
      "When the river stage is zero": false,
      "When the conductance is set to zero": true,
      "When the aquifer head equals the river stage": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. Flow stops either when the aquifer drops below the riverbed or if conductance is zero.",
    "error": "❌ Recheck. Flow stops when aquifer head is below the riverbed or when conductance is zero."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the MODFLOW RIV boundary simulate a gaining stream?",
    "options": {
      "The aquifer head is above the river stage.": true,
      "Flow is directed from aquifer to river.": true,
      "The boundary head is fixed and does not depend on aquifer head.": false,
      "The river is always gaining if the aquifer is saturated.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. A gaining stream receives flow when the aquifer head is above the river stage.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Gaining occurs when the aquifer head is above the river stage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the exchange flow as aquifer head approaches the riverbed elevation from above?",
    "options": {
      "Flow rate decreases and approaches zero.": true,
      "The riverbed becomes dry.": false,
      "MODFLOW disables the RIV boundary.": false,
      "Exchange flow becomes negative.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. The flow becomes minimal as the aquifer approaches the riverbed.",
    "error": "❌ Careful — flow tapers off but doesn't reverse or disable the boundary unless below riverbed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which statement about RIV boundaries is true?",
    "options": {
      "They simulate both gaining and losing conditions depending on head difference.": true,
      "They allow water exchange only in one direction.": false,
      "They use conductance to regulate flow magnitude.": true,
      "They override the water budget if drying occurs.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. RIV boundaries are bidirectional and governed by head difference and conductance.",
    "error": "❌ Try again. RIV allows bidirectional flow and uses conductance to model exchange."
