    "success": "✅ Correct! For our 1D model with one no-flow boundary, the outflow equals the recharge rate multiplied by the surface area (length x width). Only changes to the recharge rate will alter the total outflow.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. In our 1D steady-state model with one no-flow boundary, outflow is determined by the recharge rate only, not by hydraulic conductivity."

    "success": "✅ Correct! Lower $C_{Riv}$ increases the resistance between the groundwater model and the boundary, thus the groundwater heads must be higher to drive the same volume of water out of the boundary. Lowering  $K$ increases overall resistance of the aquifer requiring a steeper gradient in the aquifer, but the gradient between the aquifer and the river must be the same for a given outflow so the head in the cell next to the river does not change when $K$ is changed.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Increasing conductance reduces the resistance to flow and therefore a lower gradient is required to drive the same outflow to the river so heads are lower. For a given recharge and conductance, the gradient at the river is determined so the head next to the river does not change when $K$ is changed."
