    "question": "Which statements describe how a General Head Boundary (GHB) behaves? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "The flow direction depends on the difference between $H_B$ and $h_{gw}$.": true,
      "A GHB always enforces a constant discharge.": false,
      "A GHB allows variable inflow and outflow.": true,
      "GHBs are only used at the top of the model.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. GHBs simulate dynamic exchange driven by head differences.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. GHBs allow variable flow and are not restricted to a model's top layer."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which expression correctly defines the flow across a GHB? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "$Q_B = C_B(H_B - h_{gw})$": true,
      "$Q_B = K (H_B - h_{gw})$": false,
      "$Q_B = C_B h_{gw}$": false,
      "$Q_B = H_B / C_B$": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. The GHB flow equation linearly links flow to the head difference.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Review the GHB equation. It's based on conductance and the head difference."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when the groundwater head $h_{gw}$ equals the boundary head $H_B$? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "The flow $Q_B$ becomes zero.": true,
      "The boundary acts as a recharge zone.": false,
      "The flow direction reverses.": false,
      "The conductance drops to zero.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. When heads are equal, there is no driving force for flow.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. No head difference means no flow across the boundary."
  },
  {
    "question": "Increasing the conductance $C_B$ in a GHB has what impacts on the system? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "Increases flow for the same head difference.": true,
      "Changes the direction of flow.": false,
      "Increases the slope of the Q–h plot.": true,
      "Alters the external boundary head $H_B$.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes. Conductance controls the steepness of the Q–h relation and flow magnitude.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Conductance does not affect flow direction or boundary head."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which parameters jointly and directly control the flow through a GHB? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "Boundary head $H_B$": true,
      "Groundwater head $h_{gw}$": true,
      "Recharge applied elsewhere in the model": false,
      "Conductance $C_B$": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Flow is governed by conductance and the head difference.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Recharge affects heads, and may influence the flow at GHB boundaries, but is not directly in the GHB flow equation."
  },
  {
    "question": "When is a GHB considered 'gaining' from the groundwater system's perspective? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "When $H_B > h_{gw}$": true,
      "When $h_{gw} > H_B$": false,
      "When $Q_B < 0$": false,
      "When flow enters the groundwater": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. The GHB adds water to the groundwater system when its head is higher than the groundwater head resulting in more flow entering the groundwater system.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. A gaining boundary is a source of water to the system, meaning water flows into the groundwater system from the boundary."
