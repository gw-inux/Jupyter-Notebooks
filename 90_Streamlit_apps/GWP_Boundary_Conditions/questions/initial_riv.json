    "question": "Which of the following processes describe how rivers can interact with groundwater? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A river can gain water from the groundwater system.": true,
      "A river can lose water to the groundwater system.": true,
      "A river always maintains a fixed exchange rate with the groundwater.": false,
      "A river can maintain a fixed exchange rate if the groundwater head falls below the bottom of the riverbed.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. River–groundwater interaction can include gaining, losing, and drying scenarios.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. A river may gain, lose, or interact with a fixed exchange rate depending on the hydraulic gradient and bed elevation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What physical property controls the rate of exchange between q river and groundwater? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "River conductance": true,
      "River width": true,
      "Groundwater porosity": false,
      "Difference between river stage and groundwater head": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Right. The conductance and head difference control the exchange flow.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. The correct factors include river conductance, river geometry, and the hydraulic gradient."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the groundwater level falls below the riverbed bottom in a RIV boundary? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "The flow from the river to the groundwater system continues as before.": false,
      "The flow becomes zero.": false,
      "The river is assumed dry at that location.": false,
      "There is a constant flow into the groundwater system.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. Once the groundwater head drops below the riverbed bottom, flow is equal to the product of conductance and the difference between the river stage and the riverbed bottom.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. In MODFLOW, flow from the river to the groundwater is constant when the groundwater head is below the riverbed bottom."
  },
  {
    "question": "What distinguishes the RIV boundary from the General Head Boundary (GHB)? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "RIV includes a maximum inflow when the groundwater head is below the riverbed bottom.": true,
      "RIV allows flow in both directions.": false,
      "RIV is independent of hydraulic properties.": false,
      "RIV uses stage, bed elevation, and conductance to control flow.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. The RIV boundary introduces a maximum inflow rate based on riverbed bottom elevation that is not present in GHB.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. RIV flow includes a physical limit on inflow to the groundwater system based on riverbed bottom elevation. Although RIV allows both inflow and outflow that does not make it unique from a GHB"
