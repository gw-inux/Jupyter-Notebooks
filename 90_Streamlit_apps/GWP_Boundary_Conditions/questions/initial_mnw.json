    "question": "What distinguishes a Multi-Node Well (MNW) from a standard WEL in MODFLOW? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) MNW can connect to multiple model cells": true,
      "B) MNW supports head-dependent flow": true,
      "C) WEL can simulate variable conductance": false,
      "D) MNW supports physical and operational constraints": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — MNW offers advanced features like head-dependency, physical, and operational constraints.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. MNW goes beyond WEL by allowing one well to be connected to multiple cells and includes head-dependency, physical, and operational constraints."

    "question": "Which of the following are head-related constraints used in MNW simulations? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Maximum drawdown": true,
      "B) Constant recharge rate": false,
      "C) Pump discharge limits (Qmax)": true,
      "D) Minimum cell thickness": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. MNW can enforce pumping constraints based on head or flow capacity.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Head constraints and pumping limits are central to regulating discharge in MNW wells, not recharge or thickness."

  {
    "question": "What behavior can be observed in Q–h plots for MNW? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) A vertical line representing the groundwater head": true,
      "B) A slope representing head-dependent flow into the well": true,
      "C) Negative discharge when head drops below the pump intake": false,
      "D) A horizontal line representing the specified discharge from the well": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. MNW plots combine diagonal lines representing head-dependent flow with horizontal lines representing specified flow boundaries.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. MNW plots relate the groundwater head and well head with the specified flow and reduced flow. Discharge is zero when head is below the pump intake "

  {
    "question": "Why might an MNW well discharge decrease or cease during a model simulation? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Head is below the pump intake": true,
      "B) Conductance becomes negative": false,
      "C) The pumping rate falls below the minimum allowable pumping rate ": true,
      "D) The aquifer goes dry": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes — dry cells, pumping rate limits, and heads below constraints can all trigger reduced or zero discharge.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. MNW simulates physical well behavior, including limits that can shut off flow, but does not change conductance values as part of the model simulation."
