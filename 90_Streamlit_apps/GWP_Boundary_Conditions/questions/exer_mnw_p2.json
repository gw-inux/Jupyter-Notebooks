    "question": "Which statements best describe how MNW differs from a WEL boundary? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) MNW calculates head based on Q and resistance, while WEL fixes Q directly.": true,
      "B) WEL includes nonlinear losses, MNW does not.": false,
      "C) MNW models drawdown dynamically based on a function defined by CWC parameters.": true,
      "D) WEL adjusts the groundwater head based on drawdown.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. MNW allows dynamic head computation; WEL is a fixed-flux condition.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. WEL fixes Q, while MNW dynamically links Q and h based on resistance."
  },
  {
    "question": "In this plot 2, what is true about the groundwater head $h_{gw}$? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It is fixed during all computations.": true,
      "B) It varies with drawdown in the well.": false,
      "C) It provides the reference head for computing drawdown.": true,
      "D) It is computed from boundary conditions.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. In Plot 2, $h_{gw}$ is fixed and used as a reference for Δh.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. $h_{gw}$ is fixed — only $h_{well}$ and Q change depending on the selected target mode."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if the exponent $P$ in the nonlinear CWC is increased? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Drawdown increases faster with Q.": true,
      "B) The Q–h curve becomes more nonlinear.": true,
      "C) Resistance becomes more linear.": false,
      "D) Discharge increases at lower drawdown.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. Higher P makes the system more nonlinear and amplifies drawdown at higher values of Q.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Increasing P does not linearize or reduce resistance — rather it is the opposite."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what way does MNW behavior resemble a RIV boundary? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Both involve head-dependent flow exchange.": true,
      "B) Both use nonlinear resistance to compute discharge.": false,
      "C) Both simulate variable Q depending on head difference.": true,
      "D) Both allow inflow or outflow depending on the relative head conditions.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. MNW and RIV both compute Q from head differences — though MNW adds nonlinearity.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. RIV is linear; MNW can simulate nonlinear response with C and P."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when $A ≈ 0$, $B ≈ 0$, and only nonlinear resistance remains? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The Q-h-curve (flow) depends entirely on $C$ and $P$.": true,
      "B) There is no drawdown response.": false,
      "C) The Q–h-curve becomes more curved at higher Q.": true,
      "D) The model cannot simulate flow.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes. Removing A and B makes the curve purely nonlinear, dominated by C and P.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. There is still drawdown when A and B ≈ 0, but it is only controlled by a nonlinear function."
  },
  {
    "question": "In what situations does an MNW well act most similarly to a DRN boundary? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) When the parameterization makes the well equation nearly linear.": true,
      "B) When pumpage is limited (constrained) by the water level in the well": true,
      "C) When the pumping rate is capped at a maximum (Qmx).": false,
      "D) When Q is defined directly as in a WEL boundary.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. A DRN-like response emerges if the well behaves linearly and discharge Q is constrained by $h_{well}$.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Pumping caps (Qmx) or directly prescribing Q do not replicate DRN behavior."
