    "question": "A) What is a primary advantage of using MNW over WEL in groundwater modeling? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It allows distributed flow over multiple layers": true,
      "B) It includes skin and nonlinear well loss effects": true,
      "C) It abstracts pumping without accounting for drawdown": false,
      "D) It enforces physical and operational pumping constraints": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Great — MNW captures realistic well behavior including layered flow, head losses, and control limits.",
    "error": "❌ Unlike WEL, MNW handles complex multi-node flow and constraints explicitly."
  },
  {
    "question": "B) Which factors influence the cell-to-well conductance (CWC) in a Multi-Node Well? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding formation": true,
      "B) Wellbore radius and skin resistance": true,
      "C) Drain elevation in the model domain": false,
      "D) Cross-sectional flow area between cell and well": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Conductance depends on geometric and hydraulic properties around the well.",
    "error": "❌ CWC reflects subsurface and borehole properties, not unrelated boundary elevations."
  },
  {
    "question": "C) What happens to the Q–h curve of a MNW when a maximum pumping rate (QMAX) is imposed? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The Q–h curve levels off at QMAX": true,
      "B) Flow continues increasing with increasing drawdown": false,
      "C) Flow may be capped regardless of available head": true,
      "D) Flow stops entirely once QMAX is exceeded": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly — the Q–h curve reflects constraints like QMAX and limits actual abstraction.",
    "error": "❌ The curve is truncated, not reversed or endlessly increasing."
  },
  {
    "question": "D) In MODFLOW, which conditions may cause a MNW to stop pumping due to head constraints? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) When the well head drops below the limiting head (Hlim)": true,
      "B) When QMAX is reached": false,
      "C) When the cell becomes partially unsaturated": true,
      "D) When recharge is increased": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Spot on. MNW may stop pumping when physical or hydraulic head constraints are violated.",
    "error": "❌ Shutdowns relate to local head conditions, not flux limits or recharge rates."
  },
  {
    "question": "E) How is the skin effect incorporated in MNW behavior? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) As additional resistance surrounding the well": true,
      "B) As a direct increase in conductance": false,
      "C) As a term contributing to drawdown": true,
      "D) As a correction factor in recharge zones": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Skin increases resistance and contributes to head loss.",
    "error": "❌ Skin increases drawdown — it does not boost conductance or affect recharge."
  },
  {
    "question": "F) How can Q–h plots assist in interpreting MNW model behavior? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) By identifying operational and physical pumping limits": true,
      "B) By indicating when threshold heads are reached": true,
      "C) By optimizing boundary conditions like recharge": false,
      "D) By visualizing flow regime transitions and limitations": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. Q–h plots help understand how pumping responds to drawdown, thresholds, and constraints.",
    "error": "❌ These plots are used to diagnose well response, not to calibrate recharge boundaries."
