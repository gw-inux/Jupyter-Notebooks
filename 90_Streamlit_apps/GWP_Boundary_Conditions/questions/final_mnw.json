    "question": "What is a primary advantage of using MNW over WEL in groundwater modeling? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It allows distributed flow over multiple layers": true,
      "B) It includes skin and nonlinear well loss effects": true,
      "C) It allows well discharge without accounting for drawdown": false,
      "D) It enforces physical and operational pumping constraints": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes — MNW captures realistic well behavior including layered flow, head losses, and control limits.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Unlike WEL, MNW explicitly handles complex multi-node flow and constraints on well discharge."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which factors influence the groundwater system-to-well conductance (CWC) in a Multi-Node Well? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Hydraulic conductivity of the zone near the well": true,
      "B) Wellbore radius and skin resistance": true,
      "C) The riverbed conductance of nearby rivers in the model domain": false,
      "D) Cross-sectional flow area between cell and well": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Conductance depends on geometric and hydraulic properties around the well.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. CWC reflects subsurface and borehole properties, not unrelated boundary elevations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the Q–h behavior of an MNW when a restart threshold (Qmx) is defined? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) After the Qmn constraint activates, pumping remains zero unless Q exceeds Qmx.": true,
      "B) Qmx defines the minimum discharge needed to resume pumping after shutdown.": true,
      "C) Discharge continues increasing even if the well is inactive.": false,
      "D) The Q–h curve shows a step change at the Qmx limit.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Qmx ensures that pumping only restarts when sufficient head is restored and a minimum calculated Q is met.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Qmx defines restart behavior — it does not allow flow to increase while the well is active, and it does not create a visible step in the Q–h curve."
  },
  {
    "question": "In MODFLOW, what conditions may cause a MNW to stop pumping due to head constraints? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) When the well head drops below the limiting head ($h_{thr}$)": true,
      "B) When Qmx is reached": false,
      "C) When the groundwater head declines, reaching the limiting head, and the active pumping rate is < Qmn": true,
      "D) When recharge is increased": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Spot on. MNW may stop pumping when physical or hydraulic head constraints are violated.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Well shutdown is related to local head conditions and the minimum flux limit, not Qmx or recharge rates."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the well skin incorporated in MNW behavior? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) As additional resistance surrounding the well": true,
      "B) As a direct increase in conductance": false,
      "C) As a term contributing to drawdown": true,
      "D) As a correction factor in recharge zones": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Well skin increases resistance and contributes to head loss.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Skin increases drawdown — it does not increase conductance nor affect recharge."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can Q–h plots assist in interpreting MNW model behavior? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) By identifying operational and physical pumping limits": true,
      "B) By indicating when threshold heads are reached": true,
      "C) By optimizing boundary conditions like recharge": false,
      "D) By visualizing flow regime transitions and limitations": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. Q–h plots help understand how pumping responds to drawdown, thresholds, and constraints.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. These plots are used to diagnose well response, not to calibrate recharge boundaries."
