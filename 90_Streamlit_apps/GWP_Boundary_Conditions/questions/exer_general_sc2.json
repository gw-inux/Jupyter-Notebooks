    "question": "The model uses **two specified head** boundaries on the left and right side. The boundary heads are kept constant with 150 m at both sides. The groundwater **recharge is specified as ZERO**. What parameter change is suitable to increase the hydraulic heads in the aquifer? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Increasing $K$": false,
      "B) Decreasing $K$": false,
      "C) Increasing $R$": true,
      "D) Decreasing $R$": false,
      "E) None of the above": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Increasing $R$ is the only way to increase hydraulic heads in this situation.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Without Recharge $R$, there is no flow in the aquifer. Accordingly, the hydraulic conductivity is not sensitive. Only increasing recharge will result in flow and accordingly in an increase of hydraulic heads (if both boundaries are with a specified head at 150 m)."

    "question": "The model includes **specified head boundaries** on both the left and right sides, with a **uniform groundwater recharge of 200 mm/a**. A groundwater divide has formed within the domain. Which of the following variations could lead to a shift in the position of the groundwater divide? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Hydraulic conductivity": true,
      "B) Recharge": true,
      "C) Specified head in the boundaries": true,
      "D) None of the above – the groundwater divide is static.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! The groundwater divide depends on the gradient and recharge. Changing $K$, $R$, or boundary heads will shift its position.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. The position of the divide is not static — it responds to system parameters like $R$, $K$, and boundary heads."

    "question": "The model uses **two specified head boundaries** on the left and right side. The head at the left boundary is 152 m and at the right boundary is 150 m. There is no groundwater recharge. What happens if the boundary head at the left side is decreased to 150.5 m? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The outflow at the right side is increasing.": false,
      "B) The outflow at the right side is decreasing.": true,
      "C) The inflow at the left side is increasing.": false,
      "D) The inflow at the left side is decreasing.": true,
      "E) The in- and outflow at both boundaries will not change.": false,
      "F) A groundwater divide is established.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! A lower head difference means a lower gradient and thus reduced inflow and outflow.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. With no recharge and decreased head difference, the flow rates must decrease symmetrically."

    "question": "The model uses **two specified head boundaries** on the left and right side. The head at the left boundary is 150.5 m and at the right boundary is 150 m.

      "E) A decrease of the hydraulic conductivity results in an increase of outflow at the right boundary.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! The vertical Q–h plot at the left reflects constant head with variable flow. A groundwater divide forms due to recharge, and lower $K$ will result in a shift of the groundwater divide, resulting in an larger area for recharge contributing to the outflow at the left specified head boundary.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Consider the behavior of Q–h plots at specified-head boundaries and how $K$ affects the position of the groundwater divide, affecting the area that collects recharge for outflow."
