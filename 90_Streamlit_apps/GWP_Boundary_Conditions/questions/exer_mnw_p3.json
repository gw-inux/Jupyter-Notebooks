    "question": "A) What is the purpose of a threshold head ($h_{min}$) in MNW simulations? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) To prevent excessive drawdown in the well.": true,
      "B) To define a target drawdown for optimization.": false,
      "C) To trigger a reduction in Q when $h_{well}$ falls below $h_{min}$.": true,
      "D) To set the minimum allowable value for $h_{cell}$.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. The threshold head is a control to protect the well from overdraw.",
    "error": "❌ $h_{min}$ is not a target — it’s a hard lower bound for well protection."
  },
  {
    "question": "B) What happens when the computed $h_{well}$ falls below $h_{min}$? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The discharge Q is reduced automatically.": true,
      "B) The aquifer head is lowered.": false,
      "C) The simulation holds $h_{well} = h_{min}$.": true,
      "D) The CWC parameters are reset.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. The system adjusts Q to keep the well head at threshold.",
    "error": "❌ Aquifer head and parameters stay constant — only Q is limited."

  {
    "question": "C) Which conditions activate the QMAX limit? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) When user input exceeds the defined maximum Q.": true,
      "B) When the CWC equation would result in too much drawdown.": false,
      "C) When discharge is higher than allowed by management or capacity.": true,
      "D) When $h_{well} > h_{cell}$.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. QMAX is a predefined cap on allowable abstraction.",
    "error": "❌ QMAX is not a function of CWC but a management threshold."
  },
  {
    "question": "D) How does the nonlinear exponent $P$ influence the discharge–drawdown curve? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Larger P causes faster increase in drawdown at higher Q.": true,
      "B) P has no effect on threshold head activation.": false,
      "C) A higher P shifts the Q–h curve to reach $h_{min}$ earlier.": true,
      "D) Smaller P values make the system more nonlinear.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. P amplifies nonlinear resistance and affects when threshold is reached.",
    "error": "❌ P is central to curve shape and influences threshold-limiting Q."

    "question": "E) What happens if QMIN is set to –0.005 m³/s and the user inputs Q = –0.01 m³/s? (Mark ALL correct answers)",

      "B) The simulation raises $h_{well}$ to compensate.": false,
      "C) The flow is limited to QMIN to prevent over-injection.": true,
      "D) The system ignores QMIN if threshold is active.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. QMIN ensures injection or backflow is constrained.",
    "error": "❌ QMIN cannot be exceeded — it caps negative Q."

  {
    "question": "F) Which combination best describes MNW control under all limits? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Q is limited by $h_{min}$, QMAX, and QMIN.": true,
      "B) The first active limit determines the effective Q.": true,
      "C) Q is always computed from the full CWC expression.": false,
      "D) Limits only apply in Q-target mode.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. The discharge is constrained by whichever limit is active first.",
    "error": "❌ Even in H-target mode, MNW limits may apply to enforce well protection."
