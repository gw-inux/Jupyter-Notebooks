    "question": "Which statements about General Head Boundaries (GHB) are correct? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "GHBs allow both inflow and outflow depending on head conditions.": true,
      "GHBs impose a fixed head at the model boundary.": false,
      "GHBs can be used to represent a lake connected to the groundwater.": true,
      "GHBs always remove water from the system.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! GHBs simulate two-way interaction with external systems like lakes or rivers. The head of a GHB is _not at the model boundary, rather it is removed from the model boundary by a conductance layer with the head being at some distance from the model_.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. GHBs are dynamic and allow both inflow and outflow depending on changing heads. The head of a GHB is _not at the model boundary, rather it is removed from the model boundary by a conductance layer with the head being at some distance from the model_."

  {
    "question": "What does the conductance $C_B$ represent in the GHB equation? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "It combines the effects of boundary geometry and material properties.": true,
      "It is a parameter related to the slope of the Q–h relationship.": true,
      "It is the boundary head value.": false,
      "It has units of length (m).": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done! Conductance is a key parameter combining the geometry and properties of an external feature to control flow magnitude.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Conductance is not a head; and it has units of length squared over time as determined by (K Area)/L."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following leads to zero flow across a GHB? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "When groundwater head equals the boundary head.": true,
      "When conductance is very large.": false,
      "When conductance is zero.": true,
      "When $H_B > h_{gw}$.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Flow does not occur when there is no head difference or conductance is zero.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Flow only occurs when there is a head difference and a non-zero conductance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does increasing $C_B$ affect the Q–h plot? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "It increases the slope of the Q–h line.": true,
      "It shifts the boundary head $H_B$.": false,
      "It causes greater flow for the same head difference.": true,
      "It changes the direction of flow.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Higher conductance means more flow for a given head difference.",
    "error": "❌ Some of your choices are not correct. Conductance affects the slope of a Q–h plot, but not head or direction of flow."
