    "question": "Which of the following statements correctly describe a Dirac (pulse) input in 1D solute transport? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "It represents an instantaneous mass injection at a single point in time.": true,
      "It produces a breakthrough curve that has a finite width at the moment of injection.": false,
      "The total injected mass must be conserved throughout the domain.": true,

    "success": "Correct! A Dirac input is instantaneous, all mass is injected at once, and mass conservation holds.",
    "fail": "Not quite. A Dirac input is an instantaneous point-source injection; it is not a continuous boundary condition."
