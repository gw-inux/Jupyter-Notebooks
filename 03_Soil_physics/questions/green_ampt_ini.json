    "question": "Which assumptions underlie the Green–Ampt infiltration model? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "The infiltration rate is independent of hydraulic conductivity.": false,
	  "The wetting front is represented as a sharp interface.": true,
      "Soil water content above the wetting front is constant.": true,

    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! The Green–Ampt model assumes a sharp wetting front and uniform water content above it.",
    "error": "❌ Not fully correct. The model assumes a sharp wetting front and constant water content above it; it does not assume gradual transitions or independence from hydraulic conductivity."

    "question": "What does the parameter Δθ represent in the Green–Ampt model? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "The total porosity of the soil.": false,
	  "The change in volumetric water content across the wetting front.": true,
      "The pressure gradient at the surface.": false,
	  "The difference between initial and field-saturated water content.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Δθ is the difference between initial and near-saturated water content.",
    "error": "❌ Not fully correct. Δθ describes the contrast between initial and saturated water content, not porosity or surface pressure."

      "Hydraulic conductivity Ks.": true,

      "The slope of the land surface.": false,
      "The difference in water content Δθ.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Ks, Δh, and Δθ are the key controls in the Green–Ampt formulation.",
    "error": "❌ Not fully correct. Only Ks, Δh, and Δθ directly control cumulative infiltration."

    "question": "In the context of infiltration, what does ponding mean? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "No infiltration occurs during this period.": false,
      "The wetting front stops moving.": false,
	  "Rainfall exceeds the infiltration capacity.": true,
      "A water layer forms on the soil surface.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Ponding occurs when rainfall is greater than the infiltration rate, forming a surface layer.",
    "error": "❌ Ponding means rainfall exceeds infiltration capacity, but infiltration continues into the soil."
